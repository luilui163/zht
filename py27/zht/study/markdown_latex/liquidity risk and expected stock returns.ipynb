    "$r_{i,d,t}$ is the return on stock $i$ on day $d$ in month t;$r^e_{i,d,t}=r_{i,d,t}-r_{m,d,t}$,where $r_{m,d,t}$ is the return on the CRSP value-weighted market return on day $d$ in month t;and $v_{i,d,t}$ is the dollar volume for stock $i$ on day $d$ in month $t$.A stock's liquidity is computed in a given month only if there are more than 15 observations with which to estimate the regression (D>15),and we exclude a stock for the first and last partial month that it appears on the CRSP tape.The daily observations are not required to be consecutive (except that each observation requires dta for two successive days).Stocks with share prices less than \\$5 and greater than \\$1000 at the end of the previous month are excluded,and volume is measured in millions of dollars.\n",
