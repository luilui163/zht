Abstract
If price and quantity are the fundamental building blocks of any theory of market interactions, the importance of trading volume in understanding the behavior of financial markets
is clear. However, while many economic models of financial markets have been developed
to explain the behavior of pricesâpredictability, variability, and information contentâfar
less attention has been devoted to explaining the behavior of trading volume. In this article, we hope to expand our understanding of trading volume by developing well-articulated
economic models of asset prices and volume and empirically estimating them using recently
available daily volume data for individual securities from the University of Chicagoâs Center
for Research in Securities Prices. Our theoretical contributions include: (1) an economic
definition of volume that is most consistent with theoretical models of trading activity; (2)
the derivation of volume implications of basic portfolio theory; and (3) the development of an
intertemporal equilibrium model of asset market in which the trading process is determined
endogenously by liquidity needs and risk-sharing motives. Our empirical contributions include: (1) the construction of a volume/returns database extract of the CRSP volume data;
(2) comprehensive exploratory data analysis of both the time-series and cross-sectional properties of trading volume; (3) estimation and inference for price/volume relations implied by
asset-pricing models; and (4) a new approach for empirically identifying factors to be included in a linear-factor model of asset returns using volume data.

Introduction

One of the most fundamental notions of economics is the determination of prices through
the interaction of supply and demand. The remarkable amount of information contained in
equilibrium prices has been the subject of countless studies, both theoretical and empirical,
and with respect to financial securities, several distinct literatures devoted solely to prices
have developed.1 Indeed, one of the most well-developed and most highly cited strands of
modern economics is the asset-pricing literature.
However, the intersection of supply and demand determines not only equilibrium prices
but also equilibrium quantities, yet quantities have received far less attention, especially in
the asset-pricing literature (is there a parallel asset-quantities literature?).
In this paper, we hope to balance the asset-pricing literature by reviewing the quantity
implications of a dynamic general equilibrium model of asset markets under uncertainty, and
investigating those implications empirically. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we
seek to understand the motives for trade, the process by which trades are consummated,
the interaction between prices and volume, and the roles that risk preferences and market
frictions play in determining trading activity as well as price dynamics. We begin in Section
2 with the basic definitions and notational conventions of our volume investigationânot a
trivial task given the variety of volume measures used in the extant literature, e.g., shares
traded, dollars traded, number of transactions, etc. We argue that turnoverâshares traded
divided by shares outstandingâis a natural measure of trading activity when viewed in the
context of standard portfolio theory and equilibrium asset-pricing models.
In Section 3, we describe the dataset we use to investigate the empirical implications of
various asset-market models for trading volume. Using weekly turnover data for individual
securities on the New York and American Stock Exchanges from 1962 to 1996ârecently made
available by the Center for Research in Securities Pricesâwe document in Sections 4 and 5
the time-series and cross-sectional properties of turnover indexes, individual turnover, and
portfolio turnover. Turnover indexes exhibit a clear time trend from 1962 to 1996, beginning
at less than 0.5% in 1962, reaching a high of 4% in October 1987, and dropping to just over
1% at the end of our sample in 1996. The cross section of turnover also varies through time,

Structure and Pricing (D4), Price Level, Inflation, and Deflation (E31), Determination of Interest Rates and
Term Structure of Interest Rates (E43), Foreign Exchange (F31), Asset Pricing (G12), and Contingent and
Futures Pricing (G13).

fairly concentrated in the early 1960âs, much wider in the late 1960âs, narrow again in the mid
1970âs, and wide again after that. There is some persistence in turnover deciles from week
to weekâthe largest- and smallest-turnover stocks in one week are often the largest- and
smallest-turnover stocks, respectively, the next weekâhowever, there is considerable diffusion
of stocks across the intermediate turnover-deciles from one week to the next. To investigate
the cross-sectional variation of turnover in more detail, we perform cross-sectional regressions
of average turnover on several regressors related to expected return, market capitalization,
and trading costs. With R2 âs ranging from 29.6% to 44.7%, these regressions show that
stock-specific characteristics do explain a significant portion of the cross-sectional variation
in turnover. This suggests the possibility of a parsimonious linear-factor representation of
the turnover cross-section.
In Section 6, we derive the volume implications of basic portfolio theory, showing that
two-fund separation implies that turnover is identical across all assets, and that (K + 1)fund separation implies that turnover has an approximately linear K-factor structure. To
investigate these implications empirically, we perform a principal-components decomposition
of the covariance matrix of the turnover of ten portfolios, where the portfolios are constructed
by sorting on turnover betas. Across five-year subperiods, we find that a one-factor model for
turnover is a reasonable approximation, at least in the case of turnover-beta-sorted portfolios,
and that a two-factor model captures well over 90% of the time-series variation in turnover.
Finally, to investigate the dynamics of trading volume, in Section 7 we propose an intertemporal equilibrium asset-pricing model and derive its implications for the joint behavior
of volume and asset returns. In this model, assets are exposed to two sources of risks: market
risk and the risk of changes in market conditions.2 As a result, investors wish to hold two
distinct portfolios of risky assets: the market portfolio and a hedging portfolio. The market
portfolio allows them to adjust their exposure to market risk, and the hedging portfolio allows them to hedge the risk of changes in market conditions. In equilibrium, investors trade
in only these two portfolios, and expected asset returns are determined by their exposure to
these two risks, i.e., a two-factor linear pricing model holds, where the two factors are the
returns on the market portfolio and the hedging portfolio, respectively. We then explore the
implications of this model on the joint behavior of volume and returns using the same weekly
turnover data as in the earlier sections. From the trading volume of individual stocks, we

construct the hedging portfolio and its returns. We find that the hedging-portfolio returns
consistently outperforms other factors in predicting future returns to the market portfolio,
an implication of the intertemporal equilibrium model. We then use the returns to the hedging and market portfolios as two risk factors in a cross-sectional test along the lines of Fama
and MacBeth (1973), and find that the hedging portfolio is comparable to other factors in
explaining the cross-sectional variation of expected returns.
We conclude with suggestions for future research in Section 8.

Measuring Trading Activity

Any empirical analysis of trading activity in the market must start with a proper measure
of volume. The literature on trading activity in financial markets is extensive and a number
of measures of volume have been proposed and studied.3 Some studies of aggregate trading
activity use the total number of shares traded as a measure of volume (see Epps and Epps
(1976), Gallant, Rossi, and Tauchen (1992), Hiemstra and Jones (1994), and Ying (1966)).
Other studies use aggregate turnoverâthe total number of shares traded divided by the total number of shares outstandingâas a measure of volume (see Campbell, Grossman, Wang
(1993), LeBaron (1992), Smidt (1990), and the 1996 NYSE Fact Book). Individual share
volume is often used in the analysis of price/volume and volatility/volume relations (see Andersen (1996), Epps and Epps (1976), and Lamoureux and Lastrapes (1990, 1994)). Studies
focusing on the impact of information events on trading activity use individual turnover as a
measure of volume (see Bamber (1986, 1987), Lakonishok and Smidt (1986), Morse (1980),
Richardson, Sefcik, Thompson (1986), Stickel and Verrecchia (1994)). Alternatively, Tkac
(1996) considers individual dollar volume normalized by aggregate market dollar-volume.
And even the total number of trades (Conrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994)) and the number
of trading days per year (James and Edmister (1983)) have been used as measures of trading
activity. Table 1 provides a summary of the various measures used in a representative sample
of the recent volume literature. These differences suggest that different applications call for
different volume measures.
In order to proceed with our analysis, we need to first settle on a measure of volume.
After developing some basic notation in Section 2.1, we review several volume measures in
Section 2.2 and provide some economic motivation for turnover as a canonical measure of

2.1

Notation

Our analysis begins with I investors indexed by i = 1, . . . , I and J stocks indexed by j =
1, . . . , J. We assume that all the stocks are risky and non-redundant. For each stock j, let N jt
be its total number of shares outstanding, Djt its dividend, and Pjt its ex-dividend price at
date t. For notational convenience and without loss of generality, we assume throughout that
the total number of shares outstanding for each stock is constant over time, i.e., Njt = Nj ,
j = 1, . . . , J.
i
For each investor i, let Sjt
denote the number of shares of stock j he holds at date t. Let

Pt âĄ [ P1t Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ PJt ]> and St âĄ [ S1t Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ SJt ]> denote the vector of stock prices and shares
held in a given portfolio, where A> denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix A. Let the
return on stock j at t be Rjt âĄ (Pjt â Pjtâ1 + Djt )/Pjtâ1 . Finally, denote by Vjt the total
number of shares of security j traded at time t, i.e., share volume, hence
Vjt =
where the coefficient

corrects for the double counting when summing the shares traded

over all investors.

2.2

Motivation

To motivate the definition of volume used in this paper, we begin with a simple numerical
example drawn from portfolio theory (a formal discussion is given in Section 6). Consider
a stock market comprised of only two securities, A and B. For concreteness, assume that
security A has 10 shares outstanding and is priced at $100 per share, yielding a market value
of $1000, and security B has 30 shares outstanding and is priced at $50 per share, yielding
a market value of $1500, hence Nat = 10, Nbt = 30, Pat = 100, Pbt = 50. Suppose there are
only two investors in this marketâcall them investor 1 and 2âand let two-fund separation
hold so that both investors hold a combination of risk-free bonds and a stock portfolio with
A and B in the same relative proportion. Specifically, let investor 1 hold 1 share of A and 3

5

shares of B, and let investor 2 hold 9 shares of A and 27 shares of B. In this way, all shares
are held and both investors hold the same market portfolio (40% A and 60% B).
Now suppose that investor 2 liquidates $750 of his portfolioâ3 shares of A and 9 shares
of Bâand assume that investor 1 is willing to purchase exactly this amount from investor 2
at the prevailing market prices.4 After completing the transaction, investor 1 owns 4 shares
of A and 12 shares of B, and investor 2 owns 6 shares of A and 18 shares of B. What kind
of trading activity does this transaction imply?
For individual stocks, we can construct the following measures of trading activity:

This last assumption entails no loss of generality but is made purely for notational simplicity. If investor
1 is unwilling to purchase these shares at prevailing prices, prices will adjust so that both parties are willing to
consummate the transaction, leaving two-fund separation intact. See Section 7 for a more general treatment.

Although the definition of dollar turnover may seem redundant since it is equivalent to share turnover,
it will become more relevant in the portfolio case below (see Section 2.3).

Table 2 reports the values that these various measures of trading activity take on for the
hypothetical transaction between investors 1 and 2. Though these values vary considerablyâ
2 trades, 12 shares traded, $750 tradedâone regularity does emerge: the turnover measures
are all identical. This is no coincidence, but is an implication of two-fund separation. If all
investors hold the same relative proportions of risky assets at all times, then it can be shown
that trading activityâas measured by turnoverâmust be identical across all risky securities
(see Section 6). Although the other measures of volume do capture important aspects of
trading activity, if the focus is on the relation between volume and equilibrium models of
asset markets (such as the CAPM and ICAPM), turnover yields the sharpest empirical
implications and is the most natural measure. For this reason, we will use turnover as the
measure of volume throughout this paper. In Section 6 and 7, we formally demonstrate
this point in the context of classic portfolio theory and intertemporal capital asset pricing
models.

2.3

Defining Individual and Portfolio Turnover

For each individual stock j, let turnover be defined by:
Definition 1 The turnover Ďjt of stock j at time t is
Ďjt âĄ

Vjt
Nj

(2)

where Vjt is the share volume of security j at time t and Nj is the total number of shares
outstanding of stock j.
Although we define the turnover ratio using the total number of shares traded, it is obvious
that using the total dollar volume normalized by the total market value gives the same result.
Given that investors, particularly institutional investors, often trade portfolios or baskets
of stocks, a measure of portfolio trading activity would be useful. But even after settling
on turnover as the preferred measure of an individual stockâs trading activity, there is still
some ambiguity in extending this definition to the portfolio case. In the absence of a theory
for which portfolios are traded, why they are traded, and how they are traded, there is
no natural definition of portfolio turnover.6 For the specific purpose of investigating the
implications of portfolio theory and ICAPM for trading activity (see Section 6 and 7), we
propose the following definition:
p >
p
Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ SJt
] with
Definition 2 For any portfolio p defined by the vector of shares held S tp = [ S1t
p
âĽ 0 for all j, and strictly positive market value,
non-negative holdings in all stocks, i.e., Sjt

Although it is common practice for institutional investors to trade baskets of securities, there are few
regularities in how such baskets are generated or how they are traded, i.e., in piece-meal fashion and over
time or all at once through a principal bid. Such diversity in the trading of portfolios makes it difficult to
define single measure of portfolio turnover.

Although (3) seems to be a reasonable definition of portfolio turnover, some care must be
exercised in interpreting it. While ĎtV W and ĎtEW are relevant to the theoretical implications
derived in Section 6 and 7, they should be viewed only as particular weighted averages of
individual turnover, not necessarily as the turnover of any specific trading strategy.
In particular, Definition 2 cannot be applied too broadly. Suppose, for example, shortsales
are allowed so that some portfolio weights can be negative. In that case, (3) can be quite
misleading since the turnover of short positions will offset the turnover of long positions. We
can modify (3) to account for short positions by using the absolute values of the portfolio
weights

but this can yield some anomalous results as well. For example, consider a two-asset portfolio
with weights Ďat = 3 and Ďbt = â2. If the turnover of both stocks are identical and equal
to Ď , the portfolio turnover according to (5) is also Ď , yet there is clearly a great deal more
trading activity than this implies. Without specifying why and how this portfolio is traded,
a sensible definition of portfolio turnover cannot be proposed.
Neither (3) or (5) are completely satisfactory measures of trading activities of a portfolio
in general. Until we introduce a more specific context in which trading activity is to be measured, we shall have to satisfy ourselves with Definition 2 as a measure of trading activities
of a portfolio.

2.4

Time Aggregation

Given our choice of turnover as a measure of volume for individual securities, the most
natural method of handling time aggregation is to sum turnover across dates to obtain timeaggregated turnover. Although there are several other alternatives, e.g., summing share
9

volume and then dividing by average shares outstanding, summing turnover offers several
advantages. Unlike a measure based on summed shares divided by average shares outstanding, summed turnover is cumulative and linear, each component of the sum corresponds to
the actual measure of trading activity for that day, and it is unaffected by âneutralâ changes
of units such as stock splits and stock dividends.7 Therefore, we shall adopt this measure of
time aggregation in our empirical analysis below.
Definition 3 If the turnover for stock j at time t is given by Ďjt , the turnover between t â 1
to t + q for any q âĽ 0, is given by:
Ďjt (q) âĄ Ďjt + Ďjt+1 + Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ + Ďjt+q .

The Data

Having defined our measure of trading activity as turnover, we use the University of Chicagoâs
Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) Daily Master File to construct weekly
turnover series for individual NYSE and AMEX securities from July 1962 to December 1996
(1,800 weeks) using the time-aggregation method discussed in Section 2.4, which we call the
âMiniCRSPâ volume data extract.8 We choose a weekly horizon as the best compromise
between maximizing sample size while minimizing the day-to-day volume and return fluctuations that have less direct economic relevance. And since our focus is the implications of
portfolio theory for volume behavior, we confine our attention to ordinary common shares
on the NYSE and AMEX (CRSP sharecodes 10 and 11 only), omitting ADRs, SBIs, REITs,
closed-end funds, and other such exotica whose turnover may be difficult to interpret in the
usual sense.9 We also omit NASDAQ stocks altogether since the differences between NASDAQ and the NYSE/AMEX (market structure, market capitalization, etc.) have important
7

This last property requires one minor qualification: a âneutralâ change of units is, by definition, one
where trading activity is unaffected. However, stock splits can have non-neutral effects on trading activity
such as enhancing liquidity (this is often one of the motivations for splits), and in such cases turnover will
be affected (as it should be).
8
To facilitate research on turnover and to allow others to easily replicate our analysis, we have produced daily and weekly âMiniCRSPâ data extracts comprised of returns, turnover, and other data items
for each individual stock in the CRSP Daily Master file, stored in a format that minimizes storage space
and access times. We have also prepared a set of access routines to read our extracted datasets via either
sequential and random access methods on almost any hardware platform, as well as a userâs guide to MiniCRSP (see Lim et al. (1998)). More detailed information about MiniCRSP can be found at the website
http://lfe.mit.edu/volume/.

The bulk of NYSE and AMEX securities are ordinary common shares, hence limiting our sample to
securities with sharecodes 10 and 11 is not especially restrictive. For example, on January 2, 1980, the entire

implications for the measurement and behavior of volume (see, for example, Atkins and Dyl
(1997)), and this should be investigated separately.
Throughout our empirical analysis, we report turnover and returns in units of percent
per weekâthey are not annualized.
Finally, in addition to the exchange and sharecode selection criteria imposed, we also
discard 37 securities from our sample because of a particular type of data error in the CRSP
volume entries.10

Time-Series Properties

Although it is difficult to develop simple intuition for the behavior of the entire timeseries/cross-section volume datasetâa dataset containing between 1,700 and 2,200 individual
securities per week over a sample period of 1,800 weeksâsome gross characteristics of volume can be observed from value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover indexes.11 These
characteristics are presented in Figure 1 and in Tables 3 and 4.
Figure 1a shows that value-weighted turnover has increased dramatically since the mid1960âs, growing from less than 0.20% to over 1% per week. The volatility of value-weighted
turnover also increases over this period. However, equal-weighted turnover behaves somewhat differently: Figure 1b shows that it reaches a peak of nearly 2% in 1968, then declines
until the 1980âs when it returns to a similar level (and goes well beyond it during October 1987). These differences between the value- and equal-weighted indexes suggest that
smaller-capitalization companies can have high turnover.
NYSE/AMEX universe contained 2,307 securities with sharecode 10, 30 securities with sharecode 11, and
55 securities with sharecodes other than 10 and 11. Ordinary common shares also account for the bulk of
the market capitalization of the NYSE and AMEX (excluding ADRs of course).
10
Briefly, the NYSE and AMEX typically report volume in round lots of 100 sharesââ45â represents 4500
sharesâbut on occasion volume is reported in shares and this is indicated by a âZâ flag attached to the
particular observation. This Z status is relatively infrequent, is usually valid for at least a quarter, and may
change over the life of the security. In some instances, we have discovered daily share volume increasing by a
factor of 100, only to decrease by a factor of 100 at a later date. While such dramatic shifts in volume is not
altogether impossible, a more plausible explanationâone that we have verified by hand in a few casesâis
that the Z flag was inadvertently omitted when in fact the Z status was in force. See Lim et al. (1998) for
further details.
11
These indexes are constructed from weekly individual security turnover, where the value-weighted index
is re-weighted each week. Value-weighted and equal-weighted return indexes are also constructed in a similar
fashion. Note that these return indexes do not correspond exactly to the time-aggregated CRSP valueweighted and equal-weighted return indexes because we have restricted our universe of securities to ordinary
common shares. However, some simple statistical comparisons show that our return indexes and the CRSP
return indexes have very similar time series properties.

11

Since turnover is, by definition, an asymmetric measure of trading activityâit cannot
be negativeâits empirical distribution is naturally skewed. Taking natural logarithms may
provide more (visual) information about its behavior and this is done in Figures 1c- 1d.
Although a trend is still present, there is more evidence for cyclical behavior in both indexes.
Table 3 reports various summary statistics for the two indexes over the 1962â1996 sample
period, and Table 4 reports similar statistics for five-year subperiods. Over the entire sample
the average weekly turnover for the value-weighted and equal-weighted indexes is 0.78%
and 0.91%, respectively. The standard deviation of weekly turnover for these two indexes
is 0.48% and 0.37%, respectively, yielding a coefficient of variation of 0.62 for the valueweighted turnover index and 0.41 for the equal-weighted turnover index. In contrast, the
coefficients of variation for the value-weighted and equal-weighted returns indexes are 8.52
and 6.91, respectively. Turnover is not nearly so variable as returns, relative to their means.

Figure 1: Weekly Value-Weighted and Equal-Weighted Turnover Indexes, 1962 to 1996.

1995

Table 4 illustrates the nature of the secular trend in turnover through the five-year
subperiod statistics. Average weekly value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover is 0.25%
and 0.57%, respectively, in the first subperiod (1962â1966); they grow to 1.25% and 1.31%,
respectively, by the last subperiod (1992â1996). At the beginning of the sample, equalweighted turnover is three to four times more volatile than value-weighted turnover (0.21%
versus 0.07% in 1962â1966, 0.32% versus 0.08% in 1967â1971), but by the end of the sample
their volatilities are comparable (0.22% versus 0.23% in 1992â1996).
The subperiod containing the October 1987 crash exhibits a few anomalous properties:
excess skewness and kurtosis for both returns and turnover, average value-weighted turnover
slightly higher than average equal-weighted turnover, and slightly higher volatility for valueweighted turnover. These anomalies are consistent with the extreme outliers associated with
the 1987 crash (see Figure 1).

4.1

Seasonalities

In Tables 5â7b, we check for seasonalities in daily and weekly turnover, e.g., day-of-theweek, quarter-of-the-year, turn-of-the-quarter, and turn-of-the-year effects. Table 5 reports
regression results for the entire sample period, Table 6 reports day-of-the-week regressions
for each subperiod, and Tables 7a and 7b report turn-of-the-quarter and turn-of-the-year
regressions for each subperiod. The dependent variable for each regression is either turnover
or returns and the independent variables are indicators of the particular seasonality effect.
No intercept terms are included in any of these regressions.
Table 5 shows that, in contrast to returns which exhibit a strong day-of-the-week effect,
daily turnover is relatively stable over the week. Mondays and Fridays have slightly lower
average turnover than the other days of the week, Wednesdays the highest, but the differences
are generally small for both indexes: the largest difference is 0.023% for value-weighted
turnover and 0.018% for equal-weighted turnover, both between Mondays and Wednesdays.
Table 5 also shows that turnover is relatively stable over quartersâthe third quarter has
the lowest average turnover, but it differs from the other quarters by less than 0.15% for either
turnover index. Turnover tends to be lower at the beginning-of-quarters, beginning-of-years,
and end-of-years, but only the end-of-year effect for value-weighted turnover (â0.189%)
and the beginning-of-quarter effect for equal-weighted turnover (â0.074) are statistically
significant at the 5% level.
Table 6 reports day-of-the-week regressions for the five-year subperiods and shows that

Seasonality regressions for daily and weekly value-weighted and equal-weighted
turnover and return indexes of NYSE and AMEX ordinary common shares (CRSP
share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported volume) from July 1962 to December 1996. Q1âQ4 are quarterly indicators, BOQ and
EOQ are beginning-of-quarter and end-of-quarter indicators, and BOY and EOY
are beginning-of-year and end-of-year indicators.

Table 5: Seasonality (I) in Daily and Weekly Turnover and Return Indexes.

17

the patterns in Table 6 are robust across subperiods: turnover is slightly lower on Mondays
and Fridays. Interestingly, the return regressions indicate that the âweekendâ effectâlarge
negative returns on Mondays and large positive returns on Fridaysâis not robust across
subperiods.12 In particular, in the 1992â1996 subperiod average Monday-returns for the
value-weighted index is positive, statistically significant, and the highest of all the five daysâ
average returns.

Seasonality regressions over subperiods for daily value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover and return indexes
of NYSE or AMEX ordinary common shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors
in reported volume) for subperiods of the sample period from July 1962 to December 1996.

Table 6: Seasonality (II) in Daily and Weekly Turnover and Return Indexes.
12
The weekend effect has been documented by many. See, for instance, Cross (1973), French (1980),
Gibbons (1981), Harris (1986a), Jaffe (1985), Keim (1984), and Lakonishok (1982, 1988).

18

The subperiod regression results for the quarterly and annual indicators in Tables 7a
and 7b are consistent with the findings for the entire sample period in Table 5: on average,
turnover is slightly lower in third quarters, during the turn-of-the-quarter, and during the
turn-of-the-year.

It is well known that turnover is highly persistent. Table 3 shows the first 10 autocorrelations of turnover and returns and the corresponding Box-Pierce Q-statistics. Unlike
returns, turnover is strongly autocorrelated, with autocorrelations that start at 91.25% and
86.73% for the value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover indexes, respectively, decaying
very slowly to 84.63% and 68.59%, respectively, at lag 10. This slow decay suggests some

kind of nonstationarity in turnoverâperhaps a stochastic trend or unit root (see Hamilton
(1994), for example)âand this is confirmed at the usual significance levels by applying the
Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) Lagrange Multiplier test of stationarity versus a unit root to the
two turnover indexes.13
For these reasons, many empirical studies of volume use some form of detrending to induce
stationarity. This usually involves either taking first differences or estimating the trend and
subtracting it from the raw data. To gauge the impact of various methods of detrending on
the time-series properties of turnover, we report summary statistics of detrended turnover
in Table 8 where we detrend according to the following six methods:

In particular, two LM tests were applied: a test of the level-stationary null, and a test of the trendstationary null, both against the alternative of difference-stationarity. The test statistics are 17.41 (level)
and 1.47 (trend) for the value-weighted index and 9.88 (level) and 1.06 (trend) for the equal-weighted index.
The 1% critical values for these two tests are 0.739 and 0.216, respectively. See Hamilton (1994) and
Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) for further details concerning unit root tests, and Andersen (1996) and Gallant,
Rossi, and Tauchen (1992) for highly structured (but semiparametric) procedures for detrending individual
and aggregate daily volume.

(7) denotes nonparametric detrending via kernel regression (where the bandwidth is chosen
optimally via cross validation).
The summary statistics in Table 8 show that the detrending method can have a substantial impact on the time-series properties of detrended turnover. For example, the skewness of
detrended value-weighted turnover varies from 0.09 (log-linear) to 1.77 (kernel), and the kurtosis varies from â0.20 (log-linear) to 29.38 (kernel). Linear, log-linear, and Gallant, Rossi,
and Tauchen (GRT) detrending seem to do little to eliminate the persistence in turnover,
yielding detrended series with large positive autocorrelation coefficients that decay slowly
from lags 1 to 10. However, first-differenced value-weighted turnover has an autocorrelation coefficient of â34.94% at lag 1, which becomes positive at lag 4, and then alternates
sign from lags 6 through 10. In contrast, kernel-detrended value-weighted turnover has an
autocorrelation of 23.11% at lag 1, which becomes negative at lag 3 and remains negative
through lag 10. Similar disparities are also observed for the various detrended equal-weighted
turnover series.

detrend and deseasonalize the volatility of volume as well.

Table 8: Impact of detrending on the statistical properties of weekly value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover indexes of
NYSE and AMEX ordinary common shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported
volume) for July 1962 to December 1996 (1,800 weeks). Six detrending methods are used: linear, log-linear, first differencing,
normalization by the trailing four-week moving average, linear-quadratic and seasonal detrending proposed by Gallant, Rossi,
and Tauchen (1992) (GRT), and kernel regression.

Despite the fact that the R2 âs of the six detrending methods are comparable for the valueweighted turnover indexâranging from 70.6% to 88.6%âthe basic time-series properties
vary considerably from one detrending method to the next.15 To visualize the impact that
various detrending methods can have on turnover, compare the various plots of detrended
value-weighted turnover in Figure 2, and detrended equal-weighted turnover in Figure 3.16
Even linear and log-linear detrending yield differences that are visually easy to detect: linear
detrended turnover is smoother at the start of the sample and more variable towards the
end, whereas loglinearly detrended turnover is equally variable but with lower-frequency
fluctuations. The moving-average series looks like white noise, the log-linear series seems to
possess a periodic component, and the remaining series seem heteroskedastic.
For these reasons, we shall continue to use raw turnover rather than its first difference or
any other detrended turnover series in much of our empirical analysis (the sole exception is
the eigenvalue decomposition of the first differences of turnover in Table 14). To address the
problem of the apparent time trend and other nonstationarities in raw turnover, the empirical
analysis in the rest of the paper is conducted within five-year subperiods only (the exploratory
data analysis of this section contains entire-sample results primarily for completeness).17 This
is no doubt a controversial choice and, therefore, requires some justification.
From a purely statistical point of view, a nonstationary time series is nonstationary over
any finite intervalâshortening the sample period cannot induce stationarity. Moreover, a
shorter sample period increases the impact of sampling errors and reduces the power of
statistical tests against most alternatives.
However, from an empirical point of view, confining our attention to five-year subperiods
is perhaps the best compromise between letting the data âspeak for themselvesâ and imposing
sufficient structure to perform meaningful statistical inference. We have very little confidence
15

Note that the R2 âs for the detrended equal-weighted turnover series are comparable to those of the valueweighted series except for linear, log-linear, and GRT detrendingâevidently, the high turnover of small stocks
in the earlier years creates a âcycleâ that is not as readily explained by linear, log-linear, and quadratic trends
(see Figure 1).
16
To improve legibility, only every 10th observation is plotted in each of the panels of Figures 2 and 3.
17
However, we acknowledge the importance of stationarity in conducting formal statistical inferencesâit
is difficult to interpret a t-statistic in the presence of a strong trend. Therefore, the summary statistics
provided in this section are intended to provide readers with an intuitive feel for the behavior of volume in
our sample, not to be the basis of formal hypothesis tests.

in our current understanding of the trend component of turnover, yet a well-articulated
model of the trend is a pre-requisite to detrending the data. Rather than filter our data
through a specific trend process that others might not find as convincing, we choose instead
to analyze the data with methods that require minimal structure, yielding results that may
be of broader interest than those of a more structured analysis.18
Of course, some structure is necessary for conducting any kind of statistical inference.
For example, we must assume that the mechanisms governing turnover is relatively stable
over five-year subperiods, otherwise even the subperiod inferences may be misleading. Nevertheless, for our current purposesâexploratory data analysis and tests of the implications
of portfolio theory and intertemporal capital asset pricing modelsâthe benefits of focusing
on subperiods are likely to outweigh the costs of larger sampling errors.

Cross-Sectional Properties

To develop a sense for cross-sectional differences in turnover over the sample period, we
turn our attention from turnover indexes to the turnover of individual securities. Figure 4
provides a compact graphical representation of the cross section of turnover: Figure 4a plots
the deciles for the turnover cross-sectionânine points, representing the 10-th percentile,
the 20-th percentile, and so onâfor each of the 1,800 weeks in the sample period; Figure
4b simplifies this by plotting the deciles of the cross section of average turnover, averaged
within each year; and Figures 4c and 4d plot the same data but on a logarithmic scale.
Figures 4aâb show that while the median turnover (the horizontal bars with vertical
sides in Figure 4b) is relatively stable over timeâfluctuating between 0.2% and just over
1% over the 1962â1996 sample periodâthere is considerable variation in the cross-sectional
dispersion over time. The range of turnover is relatively narrow in the early 1960âs, with
90% of the values falling between 0% and 1.5%, but there is a dramatic increase in the late
1960âs, with the 90-th percentile approaching 3% at times. The cross-sectional variation of
turnover declines sharply in the mid-1970âs and then begins a steady increase until a peak
in 1987, followed by a decline and then a gradual increase until 1996.
The logarithmic plots in Figures 4câd seem to suggest that the cross-sectional distribution
18

See Andersen (1996) and Gallant, Rossi, and Tauchen (1992) for an opposing viewâthey propose highly
structured detrending and deseasonalizing procedures for adjusting raw volume. Andersen (1996) uses two
methods: nonparametric kernel regression and an equally weighted moving average. Gallant, Rossi, and
Tauchen (1992) extract quadratic trends and seasonal indicators from both the mean and variance of log
volume.

27

of log-turnover is similar over time up to a location parameter. This implies a potentially
useful statistical or âreduced-formâ description of the cross-sectional distribution of turnover:
an identically distributed random variable multiplied by a time-varying scale factor.
To explore the dynamics of the cross section of turnover, we ask the following question:
if a stock has high turnover this week, how likely will it continue to be a high-turnover stock
next week? Is turnover persistent or are there reversals from one week to the next?

To answer these questions, Table 9a reports the estimated transition probabilities for
turnover deciles in adjacent weeks. For example, the first entry of the first rowâ54.74â
implies that 54.74% of the stocks that have turnover in the first decile this week will, on
average, still be in the first turnover-decile next week. The next entryâ21.51âimplies that
21.51% of the stocks in the first turnover-decile this week will, on average, be in the second
turnover-decile next week.

Transition probabilities for weekly turnover deciles (in percents), estimated with weekly turnover of NYSE or AMEX
ordinary common shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported volume)
from July 1962 to December 1996 (1,800 weeks). Each week all securities with non-missing returns are sorted into
turnover deciles and the frequencies of transitions from decile i in one week to decile j in the next week are tabulated
for each consecutive pair of weeks and for all (i, j) combinations, i, j = 1, . . . , 10, and then normalized by the number of
consecutive pairs of weeks. The number of securities with non-missing returns in any given week varies between 1,700
and 2,200. Standard errors, computed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed transitions,
are given in parentheses.

Table 9a: Transition Probabilities of Weekly Turnover Deciles
These entries indicate some persistence in the cross section of turnover for the extreme
deciles, but considerable movement across the intermediate deciles. For example, there is
only a 18.47% probability that stocks in the fifth decile (40â50%) in one week remain in the
fifth decile the next week, and a probability of 12.18% and 11.53% of jumping to the third
and seventh deciles, respectively.
For purposes of comparison, Tables 9b and 9c report similar transition probabilities esti30

mates for market capitalization deciles and return deciles, respectively. Market capitalization
is considerably more persistent: none of the diagonal entries in Table 9b are less than 90%.
However, returns are considerably less persistentâindeed, Table 9c provides strong evidence
of reversals. For example, stocks in the first return-decile this week have a 19.50% probability of being in the tenth return-decile next week; stocks in the tenth return-decile this
week have a 20.49% probability of being in the first return-decile next week. These weekly
transition probabilities are consistent with the longer-horizon return reversals documented
by Chopra (1992), DeBondt (1985), and Lehmann (1990).

Transition probabilities for weekly market-capitalization deciles (in percents), estimated with weekly market capitalization of NYSE or AMEX ordinary common shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing
Z-errors in reported volume) from July 1962 to December 1996 (1,800 weeks). Each week all securities with nonmissing returns are sorted into market-capitalization deciles and the frequencies of transitions from decile i in one
week to decile j in the next week are tabulated for each consecutive pair of weeks and for all (i, j) combinations,
i, j = 1, . . . , 10, and then normalized by the number of consecutive pairs of weeks. The number of securities with nonmissing returns in any given week varies between 1,700 and 2,200. Standard errors, computed under the assumption
of independently and identically distributed transitions, are given in parentheses.

Table 9b: Transition Probabilities of Weekly Market Capitalization Deciles.
In summary, the turnover cross-section exhibits considerable variation, some persistence
in extreme deciles, and significant movement across intermediate deciles.

Transition probabilities for weekly return deciles (in percents), estimated with weekly returns of NYSE or AMEX
ordinary common shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported volume)
from July 1962 to December 1996 (1,800 weeks). Each week all securities with non-missing returns are sorted into
return deciles and the frequencies of transitions from decile i in one week to decile j in the next week are tabulated for
each consecutive pair of weeks and for all (i, j) combinations, i, j = 1, . . . , 10, and then normalized by the number of
consecutive pairs of weeks. The number of securities with non-missing returns in any given week varies between 1,700
and 2,200. Standard errors, computed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed transitions,
are given in parentheses.

Specification of Cross-Sectional Regressions

It is clear from Figure 4 that turnover varies considerably in the cross section. In Section
6 and 7, we propose formal models for the cross-section of volume. But before doing so,
we first consider a less formal, more exploratory analysis of the cross-sectional variation in
turnover. In particular, we wish to examine the explanatory power of several economically
motivated variables such as expected return, volatility, and trading costs in explaining the
cross section of turnover.
To do this, we estimate cross-sectional regressions over five-year subperiods where the
dependent variable is the median turnover ĎĚj of stock j and the explanatory variables are
the following stock-specific characteristics:19
19

We use median turnover instead of mean turnover to minimize the influence of outliers (which can be
substantial in this dataset). Also, within each five-year period we exclude all stocks that are missing turnover
data for more than two-thirds of the subsample.

The inclusion of these regressors in our cross-sectional analysis is loosely motivated by various
intuitive âtheoriesâ that have appeared in the volume literature.
The motivation for the first three regressors comes partly from linear asset-pricing models
such as the CAPM and APT; they capture excess expected return (ÎąĚr,j ), systematic risk
(Î˛Ěr,j ), and residual risk (ĎĚ,r,j ), respectively. To the extent that expected excess return (ÎąĚr,j )
may contain a premium associated with liquidity (see, for example, Amihud and Mendelson
(1986a,b) and Hu (1997)) and heterogeneous information (see, for example, He and Wang
(1995) and Wang (1994)), it should also give rise to cross-sectional differences in turnover.
Although a higher premium from lower liquidity should be inversely related to turnover, a
higher premium from heterogeneous information can lead to either higher or lower turnover,
depending on the nature of information heterogeneity. The two risk measures of an asset, Î˛Ěr,j
34

and ĎĚ,r,j , also measure the volatility in its returns that is associated with systematic risk and
residual risk, respectively. Given that realized returns often generate portfolio-rebalancing
needs, the volatility of returns should be positively related to turnover.
The motivation for log-market-capitalization (vj ) and log-price (pt ) is two-fold. On the
theoretical side, the role of market capitalization in explaining volume is related to Mertonâs
(1987) model of capital market equilibrium in which investors hold only the assets they are
familiar with. This implies that larger-capitalization companies tend to have more diverse
ownership, which can lead to more active trading. The motivation for log-price is related to
trading costs. Given that part of trading costs comes from the bid-ask spread, which takes
on discrete values in dollar terms, the actual costs in percentage terms are inversely related
to price levels. This suggests that volume should be positively related to prices.
On the empirical side, there is an extensive literature documenting the significance of logmarket-capitalization and log-price in explaining the cross-sectional variation of expected
returns, e.g., Banz (1981), Black (1976), Brown, Van Harlow, and Tinic (1993), Marsh
and Merton (1987), and Reinganum (1992). If size and price are genuine factors driving
expected returns, they should drive turnover as well (see Lo and Wang (1998) for a more
formal derivation and empirical analysis of this intuition).
Dividend yield (dj ) is motivated by its (empirical) ties to expected returns, but also by
dividend-capture tradesâthe practice of purchasing stock just before its ex-dividend date and
then selling it shortly thereafter.20 Often induced by differential taxation of dividends versus
capital gains, dividend-capture trading has been linked to short-term increases in trading
activity, e.g., Karpoff and Walking (1988, 1990), Lakonishok and Smidt (1986), Lakonishok
and Vermaelen (1986), Lynch-Koski (1996), Michaely (1991), Michaely and Murgia (1995),
Michaely and Vila (1995, 1996), and Stickel (1991). Stocks with higher dividend yields
should induce more dividend-capture trading activity, and this may be reflected in higher
median turnover.
The effects of membership in the S&P 500 have been documented in many studies, e.g.,
Dhillon and Johnson (1991), Goetzmann and Garry (1986), Harris and Gurel (1986), Jacques
(1988), Jain (1987), Lamoureux and Wansley (1987), Pruitt and Wei (1989), Shleifer (1986),
Tkac (1996), and Woolridge and Ghosh (1986). In particular, Harris and Gurel (1986)
20

Our definition of dj is meant to capture net corporate distributions or outflows (recall that returns R jt
are inclusive of all dividends and other distributions). The purpose of the non-negativity restriction is to
ensure that inflows, e.g., new equity issues, are not treated as negative dividends.

35

document increases in volume just after inclusion in the S&P 500, and Tkac (1996) uses
an S&P 500 indicator variable to explain the cross-sectional dispersion of relative turnover
(relative dollar-volume divided by relative market-capitalization). The obvious motivation
for this variable is the growth of indexation by institutional investors, and by the related
practice of index arbitrage, in which disparities between the index futures price and the
spot prices of the component securities are exploited by taking the appropriate positions
in the futures and spot markets. For these reasons, stocks in the S&P 500 index should
have higher turnover than others. Indexation began its rise in popularity with the advent
of the mutual-fund industry in the early 1980âs, and index arbitrage first became feasible in
1982 with the introduction of the Chicago Mercantile Exchangeâs S&P 500 futures contracts.
Therefore, the effects of S&P 500 membership on turnover should be more dramatic in the
later subperiods. Another motivation for S&P 500 membership is its effect on the publicity
of member companies, which leads to more diverse ownership and more trading activity in
the context of Merton (1987).
The last variable, the first-order return autocovariance (ÎłĚr,j (1)), serves as a proxy for
trading costs, as in Rollâs (1984) model of the âeffectiveâ bid/ask spread. In that model,
Roll shows that in the absence of information-based trades, prices bouncing between bid and
ask prices implies the following approximate relation between the spread and the first-order
return autocovariance:
s2r,j
â â Cov[Rjt , Rjtâ1 ] âĄ â Îłr,j (1)
4

(8)

q

where sr,j âĄ sj / Paj Pbj is the percentage effective bid/ask spread of stock j as a percentage
of the geometric average of the bid and ask prices Pbj and Paj , respectively, and sj is the
dollar bid/ask spread.
Rather than solve for sr,j , we choose instead to include ÎłĚr,j (1) as a regressor to sidestep
the problem of a positive sample first-order autocovariance, which yields a complex number
for the effective bid/ask spread. Of course, using ÎłĚr,j (1) does not eliminate this problem,
which is a symptom of a specification error, but rather is a convenient heuristic that allows
us to estimate the regression equation (complex observations for even one regressor can yield
complex parameter estimates for all the other regressors as well!). This heuristic is not unlike
Rollâs method for dealing with positive autocovariances, however, it is more direct.21
21

In a parenthetical statement in footnote a of Table I, Roll (1984) writes âThe sign of the covariance was

36

Under the trading-cost interpretation for ÎłĚr,j (1), we should expect a positive coefficient
in our cross-sectional turnover regressionâa large negative value for ÎłĚ r,j (1) implies a large
bid/ask spread, which should be associated with lower turnover. Alternatively, Roll (1984)
interprets a positive value for ÎłĚr,j (1) as a negative bid/ask spread, hence turnover should be
higher for such stocks.
These eight regressors yield the following regression equation to be estimated:
ĎĚj = Îł0 + Îł1 ÎąĚr,j + Îł2 Î˛Ěr,j + Îł3 ĎĚ,r,j + Îł4 vj + Îł5 pj + Îł6 dj +
Îł7 SP500j + Îł8 ÎłĚr,j (1) + j .

Summary Statistics For Regressors

Table 10 reports summary statistics for these regressors, as well as for three other variables
relevant to Sections 6 and 7:
ÎąĚĎ,j :

Intercept coefficient from the time-series regression of stock jâs
turnover on the value-weighted market turnover.

Î˛ĚĎ,j :

Slope coefficient from the time-series regression of stock jâs
turnover on the value-weighted market turnover.

ĎĚ,Ď,j :

Residual standard deviation of the time-series regression of
stock jâs turnover on the value-weighted market turnover.

These three variables are loosely motivated by a one-factor linear model of turnover, i.e., a
market model for turnover, which will be discussed in Section 6.
Table 10 contains means, medians, and standard deviations for these variables over each
of the seven subperiods. The entries show that return betas are approximately 1.0 on average, with a cross-sectional standard deviation of about 0.5. Observe that return betas
have approximately the same mean and median in all subperiods, indicating an absence of
dramatic skewness and outliers in their empirical distributions.
In contrast, turnover betas have a considerably higher means, starting at 2.2 in the first
subperiod (1962â1966) to an all-time high of 3.1 in the second subperiod (1967â1971), and
declining steadily thereafter to 0.7 (1987â1991) and 0.8 (1992â1996). Also, the means and
preserved after taking the square rootâ.

Summary statistics of variables for cross-sectional analysis of weekly turnover of NYSE or AMEX ordinary common
shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported volume) for subperiods of
the sample period from July 1962 to December 1996. The variables are: Ď j (average turnover); ĎĚj (median turnover);
ÎąĚĎ,j , Î˛ĚĎ,j , and ĎĚ,Ď,j (the intercept, slope, and residual, respectively, from the time-series regression of an individual
securityâs turnover on market turnover); ÎąĚr,j , Î˛Ěr,j , and ĎĚ,r,j (the intercept, slope, and residual, respectively, from
the time-series regression of an individual securityâs return on the market return); v j (natural logarithm of market
capitalization); pj (natural logarithm of price); dj (dividend yield); SP500
(S&P 500 indicator variable); and ÎłĚr,j (1)
j
(first-order return autocovariance). The statistics are: Âľ (mean); m (median); and s (standard deviation).

medians of turnover betas differ dramatically, particularly in the earlier subperiods, e.g., 2.2
mean versus 0.7 median (1962â1966) and 3.1 mean versus 1.9 median (1967â71), implying
a skewed empirical distribution with some outliers in the right tail. Turnover betas are also
more variable than return betas, with cross-sectional standard deviations that range from
twice to ten times those of return betas.
The summary statistics for the first-order return autocovariances show that they are
negative on average, which is consistent with the trading-cost interpretation, though there
is considerable skewness in their distribution as well given the differences between means
and medians. The means and medians vary from subperiod to subperiod in a manner also
consistent with the trading-cost interpretationâthe higher the median of median turnover
ĎĚj , the closer to 0 is the median autocovariance.22 In particular, between the first and second subperiods, median autocovariance decreases (in absolute value) from â0.851 to â0.623,
signaling lower trading costs, while median turnover increases from 0.272 to 0.446. Between
the second and third subperiods, median autocovariance increases (in absolute value) from
â0.623 to â1.007 while median turnover decreases from 0.446 to 0.291, presumably due
to the Oil Shock of 1973â1974 and the subsequent recession. The 1977â1981 subperiod is
the first subperiod after the advent of negotiated commissions (May 1, 1975), and median
turnover increases to 0.449 while median autocovariance decreases (in absolute value) to
â0.622. During the 1982â1986 subperiod when S&P 500 index futures begin trading, median autocovariance declines (in absolute value) to â0.573 while median turnover increases
dramatically to 0.704. And during the 1987â1991 subperiod which includes the October
1987 Crash, median turnover is essentially unchanged (0.708 versus 0.704 from the previous
subperiod), median autocovariance decreases (in absolute value) from â0.573 in the previous subperiod to â0.386, but mean autocovariance increases (in absolute value) dramatically
from â1.627 in the previous subperiod to â5.096, indicating the presence of outliers with
very large trading costs.
We have also estimated correlations among the variables in Table 10, which are reported
in Table 11a and 11b. It shows that median turnover is highly correlated with both turnover
beta and return beta, with correlations that exceed 50% in most subperiods, hinting at the
prospect of two or more factors driving the cross-sectional variation in turnover. We shall
address this issue more formally in Section 6.

Recall that ĎĚj is the median turnover of stock j during the five-year subperiod; the median of ĎĚj is the
median across all stocks j in the five-year subsample.

Correlation matrix of variables for cross-sectional analysis of weekly turnover of NYSE or AMEX ordinary common
shares (CRSP share codes 10 and 11, excluding 37 stocks containing Z-errors in reported volume) for subperiods of
the sample period from July 1962 to December 1996. The variables are: Ď j (average turnover); ĎĚj (median turnover);
ÎąĚĎ,j , Î˛ĚĎ,j , and ĎĚ,Ď,j (the intercept, slope, and residual, respectively, from the time-series regression of an individual
securityâs turnover on market turnover); ÎąĚr,j , Î˛Ěr,j , and ĎĚ,r,j (the intercept, slope, and residual, respectively, from
the time-series regression of an individual securityâs return on the market return); v j (natural logarithm of market
capitalization), pj (natural logarithm of price); dj (dividend yield); SP500
(S&P 500 indicator variable); and ÎłĚr,j (1)
j
(first-order return autocovariance).

Table 11b: Correlation Matrix for Weekly Turnover Regressors (continued)

41

Median turnover is not particularly highly correlated with S&P 500 membership during the first four subperiods, with correlations ranging from â10.6% (1967â1971) to 8.6%
(1972â1976). However, with the advent of S&P 500 futures and the growing popularity of indexation in the early 1980âs, median turnover becomes more highly correlated with S&P 500
membership, jumping to 22.7% in 1982â1986, 25.4% in 1987â1991, and 15.9% in 1992â1996.
Turnover betas and return betas are highly positively correlated, with correlations ranging from 25.5% (1987â1991) to 55.4% (1967â1971). Not surprisingly, log-price p j is highly
positively correlated with log-market-capitalization vj , with correlations exceeding 75% in
every subperiod. Dividend yield is positively correlated with both log price and log market
capitalization, though the correlation is not particularly large. This may seem counterintuitive at first but recall that these are cross-sectional correlations, not time-series correlations,
and the level of dividends per share varies cross-sectionally as well as average log-price.

Regression Results

Tables 12a and 12b contain the estimates of the cross-sectional regression model (9). We
estimated three regression models for each subperiod: one with all eight variables and a
constant term included, one excluding log market-capitalization, and one excluding log price.
Since the log price and log market-capitalization regressors are so highly correlated (see Lim
et al. (1998)), regressions with only one or the other included were estimated to gauge the
effects of multicollinearity. The exclusion of either variable does not affect the qualitative
features of the regressionâno significant coefficients changed sign other than the constant
termâthough the quantitative features were affected to a small degree. For example, in the
first subperiod vj has a negative coefficient (â0.064) and pj has a positive coefficient (0.150),
both significant at the 5% level. When vj is omitted the coefficient of pj is still positive
but smaller (0.070), and when pj is omitted the coefficient of vj is still negative and also
smaller in absolute magnitude (â0.028), and in both these cases the coefficients retain their
significance.
The fact that size has a negative impact on turnover while price has a positive impact is
an artifact of the earlier subperiods. This can be seen heuristically in the time-series plots of
Figure 1âcompare the value-weighted and equal-weighted turnover indexes during the first
two or three subperiods. Smaller-capitalization stocks seem to have higher turnover than
larger-capitalization stocks.
This begins to change in the 1977â1981 subperiod: the size coefficient is negative but
42

not significant, and when price is excluded, the size coefficient changes sign and becomes
significant. In the subperiods after 1977â1981, both size and price enter positively. One
explanation of this change is the growth of the mutual fund industry and other large institutional investors in the early 1980âs. As portfolio managers manage larger asset bases,
it becomes more difficult to invest in smaller-capitalization companies because of liquidity
and corporate-control issues. Therefore, the natural economies of scale in investment management coupled with the increasing concentration of investment capital make small stocks
less actively traded than large stocks. Of course, this effect should have implications for the
equilibrium return of small stocks versus large stocks.
The first-order return autocovariance has a positive coefficient in all subperiods except the
second regression of the last subperiod (in which the coefficient is negative but insignificant),
and these coefficients are significant at the 5% level in all subperiods except 1972â1976 and
1992â1996. This is consistent with the trading-cost interpretation of ÎłĚr,j (1): a large negative
return autocovariance implies a large effective bid/ask spread which, in turn, should imply
lower turnover.
Membership in the S&P 500 also has a positive impact on turnover in all subperiods
as expected, and the magnitude of the coefficient increases dramatically in the 1982â1986
subperiodâfrom 0.013 in the previous period to 0.091âalso as expected given the growing
importance of indexation and index arbitrage during this period, and the introduction of
S&P 500 futures contracts in April 1982. Surprisingly, in the 1992â1996 subperiod, the S&P
500 coefficient declines to 0.029, perhaps because of the interactions between this indicator
variable and size and price (all three variables are highly positively correlated with each
other; see Lim et al. (1998) for further details). When size is omitted, S&P 500 membership
becomes more important, yet when price is omitted, size becomes more important and S&P
500 membership becomes irrelevant. These findings are roughly consistent with those in
Tkac (1996).23
Both systematic and idiosyncratic riskâÎ˛Ěr,j and ĎĚ,r,j âhave positive and significant impact on turnover in all subperiods. However, the impact of excess expected returns ÎąĚr,j on
turnover is erratic: negative and significant in the 1977â1981 and 1992â1996 subperiods, and
23

In particular, she finds that S&P 500 membership becomes much less significant after controlling for
the effects of size and institutional ownership. Of course, her analysis is not directly comparable to ours
because she uses a different dependent variable (monthly relative dollar-volume divided by relative marketcapitalization) in her cross-sectional regressions, and considers only a small sample of the very largest
NYSE/AMEX stocks (809) over the four year period 1988â1991.

positive and significant in the others.
The dividend-yield regressor is insignificant in all subperiods but two: 1982â1986 and
1992â1996. In these two subperiods, the coefficient is negative, which contradicts the notion
that dividend-capture trading affects turnover.
In summary, the cross-sectional variation of turnover does seem related to several stockspecific characteristics such as risk, size, price, trading costs, and S&P 500 membership.
The explanatory power of these cross-sectional regressionsâas measured by R 2 ârange from
29.6% (1992â1996) to 44.7% (1967â1971), rivaling the R 2 âs of typical cross-sectional return
regressions. With sample sizes ranging from 2,073 (1962â1966) to 2,644 (1982â1986) stocks,
these R2 âs provide some measure of confidence that cross-sectional variations in median
turnover are not purely random but do bear some relation to economic factors. In order to
further analyze the cross-section of turnover, additional economic structure is needed. This
is the task for the following two sections.

Volume Implications of Portfolio Theory

The diversity in the portfolio holdings of individuals and institutions and in their motives
for trade suggests that the time-series and cross-sectional patterns of trading activity can
be quite complex. However, standard portfolio theory provides an enormous simplification:
under certain conditions, mutual-fund separation holds, i.e., investors are indifferent between
choosing among the entire universe of securities and a small number of mutual funds (see,
for example, Cass and Stiglitz (1970), Markowitz (1952), Ross (1978), Tobin (1958), and
Merton (1973)). In this case, all investors trade only in these separating funds and simpler
cross-sectional patterns in trading activity emerge, and in this section we derive such crosssectional implications.
While several models can deliver mutual-fund separation, e.g., the CAPM and ICAPM,
we do not specify any such model here, but simply assert that mutual-fund separation holds.
In particular, in this section we focus primarily on the cross-sectional properties of volume,
we assume nothing about the behavior of asset prices, e.g., a factor structure for asset returns
may or may not exist. As long as mutual-fund separation holds, the results in this section
(in particular, Section 6.1 and 6.2) must apply. However, in Section 7, we provide a specific
intertemporal capital asset pricing model, in which mutual-fund separation holds and the
separating funds are linked with the underlying risk structure of the stocks.
46

The strong implications of mutual-fund separation for volume that we derive in this
section suggest that the assumptions underlying the theory may be quite restrictive and
therefore implausible (see, for example, Cass and Stiglitz (1970), Markowitz (1952), Ross
(1978), and Tobin (1958)). For example, mutual-fund separation is often derived in static
settings in which the motives for trade are not explicitly modeled. Also, most models of
mutual-fund separation use a partial equilibrium framework with exogenously specified return distributions and strong restrictions on preferences. Furthermore, these models tend to
focus on a rather narrow set of trading motivesâchanges in portfolio holdings due to changes
in return distributions or preferencesâignoring other factors that may motivate individuals
and institutions to adjust their portfolios, e.g., asymmetric information, idiosyncratic risk,
transactions costs, taxes and other market imperfections. Finally, it has sometimes been
argued that recent levels of trading activity in financial markets are simply too high to be
attributable to the portfolio-rebalancing needs of rational economic agents.
A detailed discussion of these concerns is beyond the scope of this paper. Moreover,
we are not advocating any particular structural model of mutual-fund separation here, but
merely investigating the implications for trading volume when mutual-fund separation holds.
Nevertheless, before deriving these implications, it is important to consider how some of the
limitations of mutual-fund separation may affect the interpretation of our analysis.
First, many of the limitations of mutual-fund separation theorems can be overcome to
some degree. For example, extending mutual-fund separation results to dynamic settings is
possible. As in the static case, restrictive assumptions on preferences and/or return processes
are often required to obtain mutual-fund separation in a discrete-time setting. However, in
a continuous-time settingâwhich has its own set of restrictive assumptionsâMerton (1973)
shows that mutual-fund separation holds for quite general preferences and return processes.
Also, it is possible to embed mutual-fund separation in a general equilibrium framework
in which asset returns are determined endogenously. The CAPM is a well-known example of
mutual-fund separation in a static equilibrium setting. To obtain mutual-fund separation in
a dynamic equilibrium setting, stronger assumptions are requiredâSection 7 provide such
an example.24
24

Tkac (1996) also attempts to develop a dynamic equilibrium modelâa multi-asset extension of Dumas
(1990)âin which two-fund separation holds. However, her specification of the model is incomplete. Moreover,
if it is in the spirit of Dumas (1990) in which risky assets take the form of investments in linear production
technologies (as in Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985)), the model has no volume implications for the risky assets
since changes in investorsâ asset holdings involve changes in their own investment in production technologies,
not in the trading of risky assets.

47

Of course, from a theoretical standpoint, no existing model is rich enough to capture
the full spectrum of portfolio-rebalancing needs of all market participants, e.g., risk-sharing,
hedging, liquidity, and speculation. Therefore, it is difficult to argue that current levels
of trading activity are too high to be justified by rational portfolio rebalancing. Indeed,
under the standard assumption of a diffusion information structure, volume is unbounded
in absence of transaction costs. Moreover, from an empirical standpoint, little effort has
been devoted to calibrating the level of trading volume within the context of a realistic
asset-market model (see Lo, Mamaysky and Wang (2001) for more discussions).
Despite the simplistic nature of mutual-fund separation, we study its volume implications for several reasons. One compelling reason is the fact that mutual-fund separation has
become the workhorse of modern investment management. Although the assumptions of
models such as the CAPM and ICAPM are known to be violated in practice, these models
are viewed by many as a useful approximation for quantifying the trade-off between risk
and expected return in financial markets. Thus, it seems natural to begin with such models
in an investigation of trading activity in asset markets. Mutual-fund separation may seem
inadequateâindeed, some might say irrelevantâfor modeling trading activity, nevertheless
it may yield an adequate approximation for quantifying the cross-sectional properties of
trading volume. If it does not, then this suggests the possibility of important weaknesses
in the theory, weaknesses that may have implications that extend beyond trading activity,
e.g., preference restrictions, risk-sharing characteristics, asymmetric information, and liquidity. Of course, the virtue of such an approximation can only be judged by its empirical
performance, which we examine in this paper.
Another reason for focusing on mutual-fund separation is that it can be an important
benchmark in developing a more complete model of trading volume. The trading motives
that mutual-fund separation captures (such as portfolio rebalancing) may be simple and
incomplete, but they are important, at least in the context of models such as the CAPM and
ICAPM. Using mutual-fund separation as a benchmark allows us to gauge how important
other trading motives may be in understanding the different aspects of trading volume. For
example, in studying the market reaction to corporate announcements and dividends, the
factor model implied by mutual-fund separation can be used as a âmarket modelâ in defining
the abnormal trading activity that is associated with these events (Tkac (1996) discusses this
in the special case of two-fund separation).
Factors such as asymmetric information, idiosyncratic risks, transaction costs, and other
48

forms of market imperfections are also likely to be relevant for determining the level and
variability of trading activity. Each of these issues has been the focus of recent research, but
only in the context of specialized models. To examine their importance in explaining volume,
we need a more general and unified framework that can capture these factors. Unfortunately,
such a model has not yet been developed.
For all these reasons, we examine the implications of mutual-fund separation for trading
activity in this section. The theoretical implications serve as valuable guides for our data
construction and empirical analysis, but it is useful to keep their limitations in mind. We
view this as the first step in developing a more complete understanding of trading and pricing
in asset markets and we hope to explore these other issues in future research (see also Section
7).
In Section 6.1 we consider the case of two-fund separation in which one fund is the riskless
asset and the second fund is a portfolio of risky assets. In Section 6.2 we investigate the
general case of (K +1)-fund separation, one riskless fund and K risky funds. Mutual-fund
separation with a riskless asset is often called monetary separation to distinguish it from the
case without a riskless asset. We assume the existence of a riskless asset mainly to simplify
the exposition, but for our purposes this assumption entails no loss of generality.25 Thus, in
what follows, we consider only cases of monetary separation without further qualification.

6.1

Two-Fund Separation

Without loss of generality, we normalize the total number of shares outstanding for each
stock to one in this section, i.e., Nj = 1, j = 1, . . . , J, and we begin by assuming two-fund
separation, i.e., all investors invest in the same two mutual funds: the riskless asset and a
stock fund. Market clearing requires that the stock fund is the âmarketâ portfolio. Given
our normalization, the market portfolio S M âmeasured in shares outstandingâis simply a
vector of oneâs: S M = [ 1 Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ 1 ]> . Two-fund separation implies that the stock holdings of
any investor i at time t is given by:

Sti = hit S M

ďŁŤ

ďŁś

ďŁˇ
i ďŁŹ .. ďŁˇ
= ht ďŁ­ . ďŁ¸ ,
1

i = 1, . . . , I

(10)

25
For example, if two-fund separation holds but both funds contain risky assets (as in Blackâs (1972)
zero-beta CAPM), this is covered by our analysis of (K +1)-fund separation in Section 6.2 for K = 2 (since
two of the three funds are assumed to contain risky assets).

49

where hit is the share of the market portfolio held by investor i (and

P

i

hit = 1 for all t). His

i
holding in stock j is then Sjt
= hit , j = 1, . . . , J. Over time, investor i may wish to adjust

his portfolio. If he does, he does so by trading only in the two funds (by the assumption
of two-fund separation), hence he purchases or sells stocks in very specific proportions, as
fractions of the market portfolio. His trading in stock j, normalized by shares outstanding,
i
i
i
i
is: Sjt
â Sjtâ1
= hit â hitâ1 , i = 1, . . . , I. But this, in turn, implies Sjt
â Sjtâ1
= Sji 0 t â Sji 0 tâ1 ,

stock, normalized by shares outstanding, is identical across all stocks. This has an important
implication for the turnover of stock j:

which is given by the following proposition:
Proposition 1 When two-fund separation holds, the turnover of all individual stocks are
identical.
Proposition 1 has strong implications for the turnover of the market portfolio. From the
definition of Section 2.3, the turnover of the market portfolio is:
ĎtV W âĄ

VW
wjt
Ďjt = Ďjt ,

j = 1, . . . , J.

j=1

The turnover of individual stocks is identical to the turnover of the market portfolio. This
is not surprising given that individual stocks have identical values for turnover. Indeed,
all portfolios of risky assets have the same turnover as individual stocks. For reasons that
becomes apparent in Section 6.2, we can express the turnover of individual stocks as an exact
linear one-factor model:
Ďjt = bj FĚt ,

j = 1, . . . , J

(12)

where FĚt = ĎtV W and bj = 1.
Proposition 1 also implies that under two-fund separation the share volume of individual stocks is proportional to the total number of shares outstanding and dollar volume is
proportional to market capitalization. Another implication is that each securityâs relative
50

dollar-volume is identical to its relative market-capitalization for all t: Pjt Vjt /

in the context of a continuous-time dynamic equilibrium model with a special form of heterogeneity in preferences, but it holds more generally for any model that implies two-fund
separation.26

k >

We now impose the following assumption on the separating stock funds:
Assumption 1 The separating stock funds, Stk , k = 1, . . . , K, are constant over time.
Given that, in equilibrium,

Sk = SM .

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that the market portfolio SM is one of
the separating stock funds, which we label as the first fund. Following Merton (1973), we
call the remaining stock funds hedging portfolios.27
26

To see this, substitute Ďt Nj for Vjt in the numerator and denominator of the left side of the equation
and observe that Ďt is constant over j hence it can be factored out of the summation and cancelled.
0
27
In addition, we can assume that all the separating stock funds are mutually orthogonal, i.e., S k > S k = 0,

51

To simplify notation, we define âhikt âĄ hikt âhiktâ1 as the change in investor iâs holding
of fund k from tâ1 to t. In addition, we assume that the amount of trading in the hedging
portfolios is small for all investors:
Assumption 2 For k = 1, . . . , K, and i = 1, . . . , I, âh11t âĄ hĚ11t and âhikt âĄ ÎťhĚikt (k 6= 1),
where |hĚikt | â¤ H < â, 0 < Îť  1 and hĚi1t , hĚi2t , . . ., hĚiJt have a continuous joint probability
density.
We then have the following result (see the Appendix for the proof):
Lemma 1 Under Assumptions 1â2, the turnover of stock j at time t can be approximated
by

Sjk FĚkt + o(Îť),

In summary, we have:
Proposition 2 Suppose that the riskless security, the market portfolio, and K â1 constant
hedging portfolios are separating funds, and the amount of trading in the hedging portfolios
is small. Then the turnover of each stock has an approximate K-factor structure. Moreover,
the loading of each stock on the k-th factor gives its share weight in the k-th separating fund.
P
k = 1, . . . , K, k 0 = 1, . . . , K, k 6= k 0 . In particular, S M > S k = Jj=1 Sjk = 0, k = 2, . . . , K, hence the total
number of shares in each of the hedging portfolios sum to zero under our normalization. For this particular
choice of the separating funds, hikt has the simple interpretation that it is the projection coefficient of Sti on
PI
PI
S k . Moreover, i=1 hi1t = 1 and i=1 hikt = 0, k = 2, . . . , K.

Empirical Tests of (K +1)-Fund Separation

Since two-fund and (K+1)-fund separation imply an approximately linear factor structure for
turnover, we can investigate these two possibilities by using principal components analysis
to decompose the covariance matrix of turnover (see Muirhead (1982) for an exposition of
principal components analysis). If turnover is driven by a linear K-factor model, the first
K principal components should explain most of the time-series variation in turnover. More
formally, if
Ďjt = Îąj + Î´1 F1t + Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ + Î´K FKt + Îľjt

(17)

where E[Îľjt Îľj 0 t ] = 0 for any j 6= j 0 , then the covariance matrix ÎŁ of the vector Ďt âĄ
[ Ď1t Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ ĎJt ]> can be expressed as
Var[Ďt ] âĄ ÎŁ = ÎˇÎÎˇ >

where Î contains the eigenvalues of ÎŁ along its diagonal and Îˇ is the matrix of corresponding
eigenvectors. Since ÎŁ is a covariance matrix, it is positive semidefinite hence all the eigenvalues are nonnegative. When normalized to sum to one, each eigenvalue can be interpreted
as the fraction of the total variance of turnover attributable to the corresponding principal
component. If (17) holds, it can be shown that as the size N of the cross section increases
without bound, exactly K normalized eigenvalues of ÎŁ approach positive finite limits, and
the remaining N â K eigenvalues approach 0 (see, for example, Chamberlain (1983) and
Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983)). Therefore, the plausibility of (17), and the value of
K, can be gauged by examining the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of ÎŁ.
The only obstacle is the fact that the covariance matrix ÎŁ must be estimated, hence we
encounter the well-known problem that the standard estimator

is singular if the number of securities J in the cross section is larger than the number of time
series observations T .28 Since J is typically much larger than T âfor a five-year subperiod
T is generally 261 weeks, and J is typically well over 2,000âwe must limit our attention
to a smaller subset of stocks. We do this by following the common practice of forming a
small number of portfolios (see Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997, Chapter 5)), sorted
by turnover beta to maximize the dispersion of turnover beta among the portfolios.29 In
particular, within each five-year subperiod we form ten turnover-beta-sorted portfolios using
b
betas estimated from the previous five-year subperiod, estimate the covariance matrix ÎŁ

using 261 time-series observations, and perform a principal-components decomposition on
b For purposes of comparison and interpretation, we perform a parallel analysis for returns,
ÎŁ.

using ten return-beta-sorted portfolios. The results are reported in Table 13.

28

Singularity by itself does not pose any problems for the computation of eigenvaluesâthis follows from
the singular-value decomposition theoremâbut it does have implications for the statistical properties of
estimated eigenvalues. In some preliminary Monte Carlo experiments, we have found that the eigenvalues of
a singular estimator of a positive-definite covariance matrix can be severely biased. We thank Bob Korajczyk
and Bruce Lehmann for bringing some of these issues to our attention and plan to investigate them more
thoroughly in ongoing research.
29
Our desire to maximize the dispersion of turnover beta is motivated by the same logic used in Black,
Jensen, and Scholes (1972): a more dispersed sample provides a more powerful test of a cross-sectional
relationship driven by the sorting characteristic. This motivation should not be taken literally in our context
because the theoretical implications of Sections 6.1 need not imply a prominent role for turnover beta (indeed,
in the case of two-fund separation, there is no cross-sectional variation in turnover betas!). However, given
the factor structure implied by (K +1)-fund separation (see Section 6.2), sorting by turnover betas seems
appropriate.

indicate that the betas are computed relative to value-weighted indexes, and âĎ EW â and âREW â indicate that they are are computed relative to
equal-weighted indexes. Standard errors for the normalized eigenvalues are given in parentheses and are calculated under the assumption of IID
normality.

Table 13 contains the principal components decomposition for portfolios sorted on outof-sample betas, where the betas are estimated in two ways: relative to value-weighted
indexes (Ď V W and RV W ) and equal-weighted indexes (Ď EW and REW ).30 The first principal
component typically explains between 70% to 85% of the variation in turnover, and the first
two principal components explain almost all of the variation. For example, the upper-left
subpanel of Table 13 shows that in the second five-year subperiod (1967â1971), 85.1% of the
variation in the turnover of turnover-beta-sorted portfolios (using turnover betas relative to
the value-weighted turnover index) is captured by the first principal component, and 93.6% is
captured by the first two principal components. Although using betas computed with valueweighted instead of equal-weighted indexes generally yields smaller eigenvalues for the first
principal component (and therefore larger values for the remaining principal components)
for both turnover and returns, the differences are typically not large.
The importance of the second principal component grows steadily through time for the
value-weighted case, reaching a peak of 15.6% in the last subperiod, and the first two principal
components account for 87.3% of the variation in turnover in the last subperiod. This is
roughly comparable with the return portfolios sorted on value-weighted return-betasâthe
first principal component is by far the most important, and the importance of the second
principal component is most pronounced in the last subperiod. However, the lower left
subpanel of Table 13 shows that for turnover portfolios sorted by betas computed against
equal-weighted indexes, the second principal component explains approximately the same
variation in turnover, varying between 6.0% and 10.4% across the six subperiods.
Of course, one possible explanation for the dominance of the first principal component is
the existence of a time trend in turnover. Despite the fact that we have limited our analysis
to five-year subperiods, within each subperiod there is a certain drift in turnover; might
this account for the first principal component? To investigate this conjecture, we perform
eigenvalue decompositions for the covariance matrices of the first differences of turnover for
the 10 turnover portfolios.
These results are reported in Table 14 and are consistent with those in Table 13: the
first principal component is still the most important, explaining between 60% to 88% of the
variation in the first differences of turnover. The second principal component is typically
30
In particular, the portfolios in a given period are formed by ranking on betas estimated in the immediately
preceding subperiod, e.g., the 1992â1996 portfolios were created by sorting on betas estimated in the 1987â
1991 subperiod, hence the first subperiod in Table 13 begins in 1967, not 1962.

56

responsible for another 5% to 20%. And in one caseâin-sample sorting on betas relative to
the equal-weighted index during 1987â1991âthe third principal component accounts for an
additional 10%. These figures suggest that the trend in turnover is unlikely to be the source
of the dominant first principal component.
In summary, the results of Tables 13 and 14 indicate that a one-factor model for turnover
is a reasonable approximation, at least in the case of turnover-beta-sorted portfolios, and
that a two-factor model captures well over 90% of the time-series variation in turnover. This
lends some support to the practice of estimating âabnormalâ volume by using an eventstudy style âmarket modelâ, e.g., Bamber (1986), Jain and Joh (1988), Lakonishok and
Smidt (1986), Morse (1980), Richardson, Sefcik, Thompson (1986), Stickel and Verrecchia
(1994), and Tkac (1996).
As compelling as these empirical results are, several qualifications should be kept in
mind. First, we have provided little statistical inference for our principal components decomposition. In particular, the asymptotic standard errors reported in Tables 13 and 14
were computed under the assumption of IID Gaussian data, hardly appropriate for weekly
US stock returns and even less convincing for turnover (see Muirhead (1982, Chapter 9)
for further details). Perhaps nonparametric methods such as the moving-block bootstrap
can provide better indications of the statistical significance of our estimated eigenvalues.
Monte Carlo simulations should also be conducted to check the finite-sample properties of
our estimators.
More importantly, the economic interpretation of the first two principal components or,
alternatively, identifying the specific factors is a challenging issue that principal components
cannot resolve. More structure must be imposed on the dataâin particular, an intertemporal
model of tradingâto obtain a better understanding for the sources of turnover variation,
and we present such structure in the next section.

Volume Implications of Intertemporal Asset-Pricing
Models

In this section, we analyze the volume implications of intertemporal asset pricing models
and how volume is related to returns. We first develop an intertemporal equilibrium model
of stock trading and pricing with multiple assets and heterogeneous investors. We derive the
behavior of volume and returns. We show that both volume and returns are driven by the

An Intertemporal Capital Asset-Pricing Model

Since our purpose is to draw qualitative implications on the joint behavior of return and
volume, the model is kept as parsimonious as possible. Several generalizations of the model
are discussed in Lo and Wang (2001b).
The Economy
We consider an economy defined on a set of discrete dates: t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. There are J
risky stocks, each pays a stream of dividends over time. As before, Djt denote the dividend
of stock j at date t, j = 1, Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ , J, and Dt âĄ [D1t Âˇ Âˇ Âˇ DJt ] denote the column vector of
dividends. Without loss of generality, in this section we assume that the total number of
shares outstanding is one for each stock.
A stock portfolio can be expressed in terms of its shares of each stock, denoted by
S âĄ [S1 . . . SJ ], where Sj is the number of stock j shares in the portfolio (j = 1, . . . , J). A
portfolio of particular importance is the market portfolio, denoted by S M , which is given by
SM = Îš

(20)

where Îš is a vector of 1âs with rank J. DM t âĄ Îš> Dt gives the dividend of the market portfolio,
which is the aggregate dividend.
In addition to the stocks, there is also a risk-free bond that yields a constant, positive
interest r per time period.
There are I investors in the economy. Each investor is endowed with equal shares of the
stocks and no bond. Every period, investor i, i = 1, . . . , I, maximizes his expected utility of
the following form:
h

i

i

(21)

i
where Wt+1
is investor iâs wealth next period, Xt , Yti , Zti are three one-dimensional state

variables, and ÎťX , ÎťY , ÎťZ are non-negative constants. Apparently, the utility function in

59

(21) is state-dependent. We further assume

Yti =

I

Zti = 0

(22)

i=1

where t = 0, 1, . . ..
For simplicity, we assume that all the exogenous shocks, Dt , Xt , {Yti , Zti , i = 1, . . . , I},
are IID over time with zero means. For tractability, we further assume that Dt+1 and Xt+1
are jointly normally distributed:

where Ď =

ĎXD ĎXX

!

.

(23)

Without loss of generality, ĎDD is assumed to be positive definite.
Our model has several features that might seem unusual. One feature of the model is that
investors are assumed to have a myopic, but state-dependent utility function in (21). The
purpose for using this utility function is to capture the dynamic nature of the investment
problem without explicitly solving a dynamic optimization problem. The state dependence
of the utility function is assumed to have the following properties. The marginal utility of
wealth depends on the dividend of the market portfolio (the aggregate dividend), as reflected
in the second term in the exponential of the utility function. When the aggregate dividend
goes up, the marginal utility of wealth goes down. The marginal utility of wealth also
depends on future state variables, in particular Xt+1 , as reflected in the third term in the
exponential of the utility function. This utility function can be interpreted as the equivalent
of a value function from an appropriately specified dynamic optimization problem (see, for
example, Wang (1994) and Lo and Wang (2001a)). More discussion is given in Lo and Wang
(2001b) on this point.
Another feature of the model is the IID assumption for the state variables. This might
leave the impression that the model is effectively static. This impression, however, is false
since the state-dependence of investorsâ utility function introduces important dynamics over
time. We can allow richer dynamics for the state variables without changing the main
properties of the model.
The particular form of the utility function and the normality of distribution for the state
variables are assumed for tractability. These assumptions are restrictive. But we hope with

60

some confidence that the qualitative predictions of the model that we explore in this paper
are not sensitive to these assumptions.
In the model, we also assumed an exogenous interest rate for the bond without requiring
the bond market to clear. This is a modelling choice we have made in order to simplify our
analysis and to focus on the stock market. As will become clear later, changes in the interest
rate is not important for the issues we examine in this paper.
Equilibrium

Let Pt âĄ [P1t . . . PJt ] and Sti âĄ [S1t
; . . . ; SJt
] be the (column) vectors of (ex-dividend) stock

prices and investor iâs stock holdings respectively. We now derive the equilibrium of the
economy.
Definition 4 An equilibrium is given by a price process {Pt : t = 0, 1, . . .} and the investors
stock positions {Sti : i = 1, . . . , I; t = 0, 1, . . .} such that:

(25)

i=1

The above definition of equilibrium is standard, except that the bond market does not clear
here. As discussed earlier, the interest rate is given exogenously and there is an elastic supply
of bonds at that rate.
For t = 0, 1, . . ., let Qt+1 denote the vector of excess dollar returns on the stocks:
Qt+1 âĄ Dt+1 + Pt+1 â (1+r)Pt.

(26)

Thus, Qjt+1 = Djt+1 + Pjt+1 â (1 + r)Pjt gives the dollar return on one share of stock j
in excess of its financing cost for period t + 1. For the remainder of the paper, we simply
61

refer to Qjt+1 as the dollar return of stock j, omitting the qualifier âexcessâ. Dollar return
Qjt+1 differs from the conventional (excess) return measure Rjt+1 which is the dollar return
normalized by the share price: Rjt+1 âĄ Qjt+1 /Pjt . We refer to Rjt+1 simply as the return on
stock j in period t + 1.
We can now state the solution to the equilibrium in the following theorem:
Theorem 1 The economy defined above has a unique linear equilibrium in which
Pt = âa â bXt

The nature of the equilibrium is intuitive. In our model, an investorâs utility function
depends not only on his wealth, but also on the stock payoffs directly. In other words, even
he holds no stocks, his utility fluctuates with the payoff of the stocks. Such a âmarket spiritâ
affects his demand for the stocks, in addition to the usual factors such as the stocksâ expected
returns. The market spirit of investor i is measured by (ÎťX Xt +ÎťY Yti ). When (ÎťX Xt +ÎťZ Yti )
is positive, investor i extracts positive utility when the aggregate stock payoff is high. Such
a positive âattachmentâ to the market makes holding stocks less attractive to him. When
(ÎťX Xt +ÎťY Yti ) is negative, he has a negative attachment to the market, which makes holding
stocks more attractive. Such a market spirit at the aggregate level, which is captured by
Xt , affects the aggregate stock demand, which in turn affects their equilibrium prices. Given
62

the particular form of the utility function, Xt affects the equilibrium stock prices linearly.
The idiosyncratic differences among investors in their market spirit, which are captured by
Yti , offset each other at the aggregate level, thus do not affect the equilibrium stock prices.
However, they do affect individual investorsâ stock holdings. As the first term of (28) shows,
investors with positive Yti âs hold less stocks (they are already happy by just âwatchingâ the
stocks paying off).
Since the aggregate utility variable Xt is driving the stock prices, it is also driving the
stock returns. In fact, the expected returns on the stocks are changing with Xt (see the
discussion in the next section). The form of the utility function further states that the
investors utility function directly depends on Xt , which fully characterizes the investment
opportunities investors face. Such a dependence endogenously arises when investors optimize
dynamically. In our setting, however, we assume that investors optimize myopically but
insert such a dependence directly into the utility function. This dependence induces investors
to care about future investment opportunities when choose their portfolios. In particular,
they prefer those portfolios whose returns can help them to smooth fluctuations in their
utility due to changes in investment opportunities. Such a preference gives rise to the hedging
component in their asset demand, which is captured by the second term in (28).

7.2

The Behavior of Returns and Volume

Given the intertemporal CAPM defined above, we can derive the its implications on the
behavior of return and volume. For the stocks, their dollar return vector can be re-expressed
as follows:
Qt+1 = ra + (1+r)bXt + QĚt+1

(29)

where QĚt+1 âĄ Dt+1 â bZt+1 denotes the vector of unexpected dollar returns on the stocks,
which are IID over time with zero mean. Equation (29) shows that the expected returns on
the stocks change over time. In particular, they are driven by a single state variable X t .
The investors stock holdings can be expressed in the following form:
Sti = hiM t Îš + hiHt S H

63

â i = 1, 2, . . . , I

(30)

where hiM t âĄ I â1 â ÎťY Yti , hiHt âĄ ÎťZ (b0 Îš)Yti â ÎťY Zti , and
S H âĄ (ĎQQ )â1 ĎQX .

(31)

Equation (30) simply states that three-fund separation holds for the investorsâ stock portfolios. That is, all investorsâ portfolios can be viewed as investments in three common funds:
the risk-free asset and two stock funds. The two stock funds are the market portfolio Îš and
the hedging portfolio SH . Moreover, in our current model, these two portfolios, expressed in
terms of stock shares, are constant over time.
The particular structure of the returns and the investorsâ portfolios lead to several interesting predictions about the behavior of volume and returns. We present these predictions
through a set of propositions.
The Cross Section of Volume
Given that investors only hold and trade in two stock funds, the results obtained in Section
6 apply here. The turnover of stock j is given by

Ďjt âĄ

â j = 1, . . . , J.

(32)

Let Ďt denote the vector of turnover for all stocks. We have the following proposition on the
cross-section of volume, which follows from Proposition 2:
Proposition 3 When investorsâ trading in the hedging portfolio is small relative to their
trading in the market portfolio, the two-fund separation in their stock holdings leads to an
approximate two-factor structure for stock turnover:
Ďt â ÎšFM t + S H FHt
where
FM t =

(33)

In the special case when two-fund separation holds (when Xt = 0 â t), turnover would have
an exact one-factor structure, Ďt = ÎšFM t .
In the general case when three-fund separation holds, turnover has an approximate twofactor structure as given in (33). It is important to note that the loading of stock jâs
turnover on the second factor is proportional to its share weight in the hedging portfolio.
Thus, empirically if we can identify the two common factors, FM t and FHt , the stocksâ
loadings on the second factor allow us to identify the hedging portfolio. In our empirical
analysis, we explore this information that the cross-section of volume conveys. As we discuss
below, the hedging portfolio has important properties that allow us to better understand the
behavior of returns. Merton (1971) has discussed the properties of hedging portfolios in a
continuous-time framework as a characterization of equilibrium. Our discussion here follows
Merton in spirit, but is in a discrete-time, equilibrium environment.
Time Series Implications for the Hedging Portfolio
By the definition of the hedging portfolio in (31), it is easy to show that its current return
gives the best forecast of future market return.
Let QM t+1 denote the dollar return on the market portfolio in period t + 1 and QHt+1
denote the dollar return on the hedging portfolio. Then,
QM t+1 = Îš> Qt+1

and QHt+1 = S H > Qt+1 .

(34)

For an arbitrary portfolio S, its dollar return in period t, which is Qt âĄ S 0 Qt , can serve as
a predictor for the dollar of the market next period:
QM t+1 = Îł0 + Îł1 Qt + ÎľMt+1 .
The predictive power of S is measured by the R2 of the above regression. We can solve for
the portfolio that maximizes the R2 . The solution, up to a scaling constant, is the hedging
portfolio. Thus, we have the following result:
Proposition 4 Among the returns of all portfolios, the dollar return of the hedging portfolio,
SH , provides the best forecast for the future dollar return of the market.
In other words, if we regress the market dollar return on the lagged dollar return of any
portfolios, the hedging portfolio gives the highest R2 .

Cross-Sectional Implications for the Hedging Portfolio
We now turn to examine the predictions of our model on the cross-section of returns. For
expositional simplicity, we introduce some additional notation. Let Qpt+1 be the dollar return
of a stock or a portfolio (of stocks). QĚpt+1 âĄ Qpt+1 â Et [Qpt+1 ] then denotes its unexpected
dollar return and QĚp its unconditional mean. Thus, QĚM t+1 and QĚHt+1 denote, respectively,
the unexpected dollar returns on the market portfolio and the hedging portfolio, and

Equation (35) characterizes the cross-sectional variation in the stocksâ expected dollar returns.
In order to develop more intuition about (35), we first consider the special case when
Xt = 0 â t. In this case, returns are IID over time. The risk of a stock is measured by its
co-variability with the market portfolio. We have the following result:
Proposition 5 When Xt = 0 â t, we have
h

i

E QĚt+1 |QĚMt+1 = Î˛M QĚM t+1
where
Î˛M âĄ Cov[QĚt+1 , QĚM t+1 ]/Var[QĚM t+1 ] = ĎDD Îš/(Îš0 ĎDD Îš)

is the vector of the stocksâ market betas. Moreover,
QĚ = Î˛M QĚM

(37)

2
where QĚM = ÎťĚĎM
.

Obviously in this case, the CAPM holds for the dollar returns. It can be shown that it also
holds for the returns.
In the general case when Xt changes over time, there is an additional risk due to changing
market conditions (dynamic risk). Moreover, this risk is represented by the dollar return
of the hedging portfolio QHt . In this case, the risk of a stock is measured by its risk with
respect to the market portfolio and its risk with respect to the hedging portfolio. In other
words, there are two risk factors, the (contemporaneous) market risk and the (dynamic) risk
of changing market conditons. The expected returns of the stocks are then determined by
their exposures to these two risks and the associated risk premia. The result is summarized
in the following proposition:
Proposition 6 When Zt changes over time, we have
h

2
2
where QĚM = ÎąĚĎM

.

Thus, a stockâs market risk is measured by its beta with respect to the market portfolio
and its risk to a changing environment is measured by its beta with respect to the hedging
67

portfolio. The expected dollar return on the market portfolio gives the premium of the
market risk and the expected dollar return on the hedging portfolio gives the premium of
the dynamic risk. (39) simply states that the premium on a stock is then given by the sum
of the product of its exposure to each risk and the associated premium.
The pricing relation we obtain in Proposition 6 is in the spirit of Mertonâs Intertemporal
CAPM in a continuous-time framework (Merton, 1971). However, it is important to note
that Mertonâs result is a characterization of the pricing relation under a (class of) proposed
price processes and no equilibrium is provided to support these price processes. In contrast,
our pricing relation is derived from a dynamic equilibrium model. In this sense, we model
provides an particular equilibrium model for which Mertonâs characterization holds.
If we can identify the hedging portfolio empirically, its return provides the second risk
factor. Differences in the stocksâ expected returns can then be fully explained by their
exposures to the two risks (market risk and dynamic risk), as measured by their market
betas and hedging betas.

Empirical Construction of the Hedging Portfolio

In the rest of this section, we present some empirical evidence on the theoretical predictions.
Our first step is to empirically identify the hedging portfolio using the turnover data. From
(33), we know that in the two-factor model for turnover in Proposition 3, stock jâs loading on
the second factor FHt yields the number of shares (as a fraction of its total number of shares
outstanding) of stock j in the hedging portfolio. In principle, this specifies the hedging portfolio. However, we face two challenges in practice. First, the exact two-factor specification
(33) is, at best, an approximation for the true data-generating process of turnover. Second,
the two common factors are generally not observable. We address both of these problems in
turn.
A more realistic starting point for modelling turnover is an approximate two-factor model:
Ďjt = FM t + Î¸Hj FHt + Îľjt ,

j = 1, . . . , J

(40)

where FM t and FHt are the two factors that generate trading in the market portfolio and
the hedging portfolio, respectively, Î¸Hj is the percentage of shares of stock j in the hedging
portfolio (as a percentage of its total number of shares outstanding), and Îľjt is the error

68

term, which is assumed to be independent across stocks.31
Since we do not have any sufficient theoretical foundation to identify the two common
factors FM t and FHt , we use two turnover indexes as their proxies: the equally-weighted and
share-weighted turnover of the market. Specifically. let Nj denote the total number of shares
outstanding for stock j and N âĄ

of all shares (of all stocks) in the hedging portfolio, respectively, and ÎľEW
and ÎľSW
are the
t

error terms for the two indexes.32 Since the error terms in (40) are assumed to be independent
across stocks, the error terms of the two indexes, which are weighted averages of the error
terms of individual stocks, become negligible when the number of stocks is large. For the
remainder of our analysis, we shall ignore them.
Simple algebra then yields the following relation between individual turnover and the
two indexes (see Lo and Wang (2001b) for more details):

(42c)

Cross-sectional independence of the errors is a restrictive assumption. If, for example, there are other
common factors in addition to FM t and FHt , then Îľjt is likely to be correlated across stocks. However, the
evidence presented in Section 6 seems to support the two-factor structure, which provides limited justification
for our assumption here.
32
To avoid degeneracy, we need Nj 6= Nk for some j 6= k, which is surely valid empirically.

Using the MiniCRSP volume database, we can empirically estimate {Î˛ĎEW
j } and {Î˛Ď j }

by estimating (42). From the estimates {Î˛bĎEW

weights of the hedging portfolio in the following manner

SW
Î¸bHj = (nEW â nSW )Î˛bĎEW
.
j +n

(43)

However, there are two remaining parameters, nEW and nSW , that need to be estimated.
It should be emphasized that these two remaining degrees of freedom are inherent in the
model (40). When the two common factors are not observed, the parameters {Î¸H j} are only
identified up to a scaling constant and a rotation. Clearly, (40) is invariant when FHt is
rescaled as long as {Î¸Hj } is also rescaled appropriately. In addition, when the two factors
are replaced by their linear combinations, (40) remains formally the same as long as {Î¸ Hj } is
also adjusted with an additive constant.33 Since the hedging portfolio {Î¸Hj } is defined only
up to a scaling constant, we let
nSW = 1

(44a)

nEW â nSW = Ď

(44b)

where Ď is a parameter that we calibrate to the data (see Section 7.4). This yields the final
expression for the J components of the hedging portfolio:
Î¸bHj = Ď Î˛bĎEW
j + 1.

(45)

The normalization nSW = 1 sets the total number of shares in the portfolio to a positive
value. If Ď = 0, the portfolio has equal percentage of all the shares of each company, implying
that it is the market portfolio. Nonzero values of Ď represent deviations from the market
33

For example, for any a, we have â j:
Ďjt = FM t + Î¸Hj FH t + Îľjt = (FM t + aFHt ) + (Î¸Hj â a)FH t + Îľjt = FĚM t + Î¸ĚHj FH t + Îľjt

where FĚM t = FM t + aFHt and Î¸ĚHj = Î¸Hj â a.

SW
To estimate {Î˛ĎEW
j } and {Î˛Ď j }, we first construct the two turnover indexes. We estimate

(42)â(42) for each of the seven five-year subperiods, ignoring the global constraint (42). 34
Therefore, we estimate constrained linear regressions of the weekly turnover for each stock
on equal- and share-weighted turnover indexes in each of the seven five-year subperiods of
our sample.
Tables 15a and 15b reports summary statistics for these constrained regressions. To
provide a clearer sense of the dispersion of these regressions, we first sort them into deciles
based on {Î˛bĎEW
j }, and then compute the means and standard deviations of the estimated

2
bSW
coefficients {Î˛bĎEW
j } and {Î˛Ď j }, their t-statistics, and the RĚ s within each decile. The t-

statistics indicate that the estimated coefficients are generally significantâeven in the fifth

and sixth deciles, the average t-statistic for {Î˛bĎEW
j } is 4.585 and 6.749, respectively (we would,
of course, expect significant t-statistics in the extreme deciles even if the true coefficients were

zero, purely from sampling variation). The RĚ2 s also look impressive, however, they must be
interpreted with some caution because of the imposition of the constraint (42), which can
yield RĚ2 greater than unity and less than zero.35 Tables 15a and 15b show that negative
RĚ2 s appear mainly in the two extreme deciles, except in the last subperiod when they are
negative for all the deciles, presumably an indication that the constraint is not consistent
with the data in this last subperiod.
For comparison, we estimate the unconstrained version of (42) and compute the same
summary statistics, reported in Tables 16a and 16b, along with the mean and standard
deviation within each decile of p-values corresponding to the statistic that (42) holds. Except
for the last subperiod, the constraint seems to be reasonably consistent with the data, with
average p-values well above 5% for all but the extreme deciles in most subperiod. For
example, in the first subperiod, the average p-values range from a minimum of 4.0% in decile
1 to a maximum of 32.4% in decile 6, and with a value of 19.4% in decile 10. However, in
the last subperiod, the average p-value is less than 5% deciles 2â6, and close to significance
for most of the other deciles, which explains the negative RĚ2 s in Tables 15a and 15b.
Without the constraint, the RĚ2 s in Tables 16a and 16b are well behaved, and of similar
34
We ignore this constraint for two reasons. First, given the large number of stocks in our sample,
imposing a global constraint like (42) requires a large amount of computer memory, which was unavailable
to us. Second, because of the large number of individual regressions involved, neglecting the reduction of
one dimension should not significantly affect any of the final results.

Table 15a: Summary statistics for the restricted volume betas using weekly returns and volume data for
NYSE and AMEX stocks from 1962 to 1981 in five-year subperiods. Turnover over individual stocks is
regressed on the equally-weighted and share- weighted turnover indices, subject to the restriction that the
two regression coefficients, Î˛bĎEW and Î˛bĎSW , must add up to one. The stocks are then sorted into ten deciles
by Î˛bĎEW . The summary statistics are then reported for each decile.

The Forecast Power of the Hedging Portfolio

Having constructed the hedging portfolio up to a parameter Ď to be determined, we can
examine its time-series properties as predicted by the model. In particular, in this section
we focus on the degree to which the the hedging portfolio can predict future stock returns,
especially the return on the market portfolio. We first construct the returns of the hedging

portfolio in Section 7.4 by calibrating Ď, and then compare its forecast power with other
factors in Sections 7.4 and 7.4.
Hedging-Portfolio Returns
To construct the return on the hedging portfolio, we begin by calculating its dollar value
and dollar returns. Let k denote subperiod k, k = 2, . . . , 7, Vjt (k) denote the total market
capitalization of stock j at time period t (the end of week t) in subperiod k, Qjt (k) denote its dividend-adjusted excess dollar return for the same period, and Rjt (k) denote the
dividend-adjusted excess return, and Î¸j (k) the estimated share (as fraction of its total shares
outstanding) in the hedging portfolio in subperiod k.
For stock j to be included in the hedging portfolio in subperiod k, which we shall refer to
as the âtesting periodâ, we require it to have volume data for at least one third of the sample
in the previous subperiod (kâ1), which we call the âestimation periodâ. Among the stocks
satisfying this criteria, we eliminate those ranked in the top and bottom 0.5% according to
their volume betas (or their share weights in the hedging portfolio) to limit the potential
impact of outliers.36 We let Jt (k) denote the set of stocks that survive these two filters and
that have price and return data for week t of subperiod k. The hedging portfolio in week t
of sub-period k is then given by:

is the value of the hedging portfolio at the beginning of the week.
The procedure outlined above yields the return and the dollar return of the hedging
portfolio up to the parameter Ď, which must be calibrated. To do so, we exploit a key
property of the hedging portfolio: its return is the best forecaster of future market returns
(see Section 7.2). Therefore, for a given value of Ď, we can estimate the following regression
RM t+1 = Î´0 + Î´1 {RHt or QHt } + ÎľM t+1

(50)

where the single regressor is either the return of the hedging portfolio RHt or its dollar return
for a given choice of Ď, and then vary Ď to maximize the RĚ2 .37 In all cases, there is a unique
global maximum, from which we obtain Ď. However, for some values of Ď, the value of
the hedging portfolio changes sign, and in these cases, defining the return on the portfolio
becomes problematic. Therefore, we eliminate these values from consideration, and for all
subperiods except subperiod 4 and 7 (i.e., subperiods 2, 3, 5, 6), the omitted values of Ď do
not seem to affect the choice of Ď for the maximum R2 (see Lo and Wang (2001) for more
discussions on the choice of Ď).
For subperiods 2 to 7, the values for Ď that give the maximum R 2 are 1.25, 4.75, 1.75,
47, 38, and 0.25, respectively, using RHt as the predictor. Using QHt , the values of Ď are
1.5, 4.25, 2, 20, 27, and 0.75, respectively. With these values of Ď in hand, we have fully
specified the hedging portfolio, its return and dollar return. Table 17 reports the summary
statistics for the return and dollar return on the hedging portfolio.
Optimal Forecasting Portfolios (OFPs)
Having constructed the return of the hedging portfolio in Section 7.4, we wish to compare its
forecast power to those of other forecastors. According to Proposition 4, the returns of the
hedging portfolio should outperform the returns of any other portfolios in predicting future
market returns. Specifically, if we regress RM t on the lagged return of any arbitrary portfolio
37

This approach ignores the impact of statistical variation on the âoptimalâ Ď, which is beyond the scope
of this paper but is explored further in related contexts by Foster, Smith, and Whaley (1997) and Lo and
MacKinlay (1997).

p, the RĚ2 should be less than that of (50).
It is impractical to compare (50) to all possible portfolios, and uninformative to compare it to random portfolios. Instead, we need only make comparisons to âoptimal forecast
portfoliosâ, portfolios that are optimal forecasters of RM t , since by construction, no other
portfolios can have higher levels of predictability than these. The following proposition shows
how to construct optimal forecasting portfolios (OFPs) (see Lo and Wang, 2001 for details):
Proposition 7 Let Î0 and Î1 denote the contemporaneous and first-order autocovariance
matrix of the vector of all returns. For any arbitrary target portfolio q with weights w q =
(wq1 ; . . . ; wqN ), define A âĄ Î0 â1 Î1 wq wq 0 Î1 0 . The optimal forecast portfolio of wq is given by
the normalized eigenvector of A corresponding to its largest eigenvalue.
Since Î0 and Î1 are unobservable, they must be estimated using historical data. Given
the large number of stocks in our sample (over 2,000 in each subperiod) and the relatively
short time series in each subperiod (261 weekly observations), the standard estimators for
Î0 and Î1 are not viable. However, it is possible to construct OFPs from a much smaller
number of âbasis portfoliosâ, and then compare the predictive power of these OFPs to the
hedging portfolio. As long as the basis portfolios are not too specialized, the RĚ2 s are likely
to be similar to those obtained from the entire universe of all stocks.
We form several sets of basis portfolios by sorting all the J stocks into K groups of
equal numbers (K â¤ J) according to: market capitalization, market beta, and SIC codes,
and then construct value-weighted portfolios within each group.38 This procedure yields K
basis portfolios for which the corresponding Î0 and Î1 can be estimated using the portfoliosâ
weekly returns within each subperiod. Based on the estimated autocovariance matrices, the
OFP can be computed easily according to Proposition 7.
In selecting the number of basis portfolios K, we face the following trade-off: fewer portfolios yield better sampling properties for the covariance matrix estimators, but less desirable
properties for the OFP since the predictive power of the OFP is obviously maximized when
when K = J. As a compromise, for the OFPs based market capitalization and market betas,
we choose K to be 10, 15, 20, and 25. For the OFP based on SIC codes, we choose 13
industry groupings, described in more detail below.
38

It is important that we use value-weighted portfolios here so that the market portfolio, whose return
we wish to predict, is a portfolio of these basic portfolios (recall that the target portfolio Ď q that we wish
to forecast is a linear combination of the vector of returns for which Îk is the k-th order autocovariance
matrix).

79

Specifically, for each five-year subperiod in which we wish to evaluate the forecast power
of the hedging portfolio (the testing period), we use the previous five-year subperiod (the
estimation period) to estimate the OFPs. For the OFP based on 10 market-capitalizationsorted portfolios, which we call âCAP10â, we construct 10 value-weighted portfolios each
week, one for each market-capitalization decile. Market-capitalization deciles are recomputed
each week, and the time series of decile returns form the 10 basis portfolio returns of CAP10,
with which we can estimate Î0 and Î1 . To compute the OFP, we also require the weights
Ďq of the target portfolio, in this case the market portfolio. Since the testing period follows
the estimation period, we use the market capitalization of each group in the last week of the
estimation period to map the weights of the market portfolio into a 10Ă1-vector of weights
for the 10 basis portfolios. The weights of the OFP for the basis portfolios CAP10 follow
immediately from Proposition 7. The same procedure is used to form OFPs for CAP15,
CAP20, and CAP25 basis portfolios.
The OFPs of market-beta-sorted basis portfolios are constructed in a similar manner.
We first estimate the market betas of individual stocks in the estimation period, sort them
according to their estimated betas and then form small groups of basis portfolios, calculating
value-weighted returns for each group. We consider 10, 15, 20 and 25 groups, denoted by
âBeta10â, âBeta15â, and so on. The same procedure is then followed to construct the OFPs
for each of these sets of basis portfolios.
Finally, the industry portfolios are based on SIC-code groupings. The first two digits
of the SIC code yield sixty to eighty industry categories, depending on the sample period,
and some of categories contain only one or two stocks. On the other, the first digit yields
only eight broad industry categories. As a compromise, we use a slightly more disaggregated
grouping of 13 industries, given by the following correspondence:39

Each week, stocks are sorted according to their SIC codes into the 13 categories defined above,
and value-weighted returns are computed for each group, yielding the 13 basis portfolios
which we denote by âSIC13â. The autocovariance matrices are then estimated and the OFP
constructed according to Proposition 7.
Hedging Portfolio Return as A Predictor of Market Returns
Tables 18a and 18b reports the results of the regressions of RM t on various lagged OFP
returns and on the hedging portfolios RHt and QHt . For completeness, we have also included
four additional regressions, with lagged value- and equal-weighted CRSP index returns, the
logarithm of the reciprocal of lagged market-capitalization, and the lagged three-month
constant-maturity Treasury bill return as predictors.40 Tables 18a and 18b show that the
hedging portfolios outperforms all of the other competing portfolios in forecasting future
market returns in three of the six subperiods (subperiods 2, 4, and 6). In subperiod 3,
only one OFP (Beta20) outperforms the hedging portfolio, and in subperiod 5, Beta20 and
SIC13âs OFPs outperform the hedging portfolio, but only marginally. And in subperiod 7,
the equal-weighted CRSP index return outperforms the hedging portfolio.
However, several caveats should be kept in mind with regard to the three subperiods in
which the hedging portfolios were surpassed by one or two competing portfolios. First, in
40

We also considered nine other interest-rate predictors (six-month and one-year Treasury bill rates,
three-month, six-month, and one-year off-the-run Treasury bill rates, one-month and three-month CD
and Eurodollar rates, and the Fed Funds rate (all obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,
http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/data/wkly.html). Each of these variables produced results similar to those for
the three-month constant-maturity Treasury bill return, hence we omit those regressions from Tables 18a
and 18b.

81

these three subperiods, the hedging portfolio still outperforms most of the other competing
portfolios. Second, there is no consistent winner in these subperiods. Third, the performance of the hedging portfolios are often close to the best performer. Moreover, the best
performers in these subperiods performed poorly in the other subperiods, raising the possibility that their performance might be due to sampling variation. In contrast, the hedging
portfolios forecasted RM t consistently in every subperiod. Indeed, among all of the regressors, the hedging portfolios were the most consistent across all six subperiods, a remarkable
confirmation of the properties of the model of Sections 7.1 and 7.2.41

41

On the other hand, the results in Tables 18a and 18b must be tempered by the fact that the OFPs
are only as good as the basis portfolios from which they are constructed. Increasing the number of basis
portfolios should, in principle, increase the predictive power of the OFP. However, as the number of basis
portfolios increases, the estimation errors in the autocovariance estimators Îł
b0 and Îł
b1 also increase for a fixed
set of time series observations, hence the impact on the predictive power of the OFP is not clear.

The Hedging-Portfolio Return as a Risk Factor

To evaluate the success of the hedging-portfolio return as a risk factor in the cross section
of expected returns, we implement a slightly modified version of the well-known regression
tests outlined in Fama and MacBeth (1973). The basic approach is the same: form portfolios
sorted by an estimated parameter such as market beta coefficients in one time period (the
âportfolio-formation periodâ), estimate betas for those same portfolios in a second nonoverlapping time period (the âestimation periodâ), and perform a cross-sectional regression
test for the explanatory power of those betas using the returns of a third non-overlapping
time period (the âtesting periodâ). However, in contrast to Fama and MacBeth (1973), we
use weekly instead of monthly returns, and our portfolio-formation, estimation, and testing
periods are five years each.42
Specifically, we run the following bivariate regression for each security in the portfolioformation period, using only those securities that exist in all three periods:43
Rjt = Îąj + Î˛jM RM t + Î˛jH RHt + Îľit

(51)

where RM t is the return on the CRSP value-weighted index and RHt is the return on the
hedging portfolio. Using the estimated coefficients {Î˛biM } and {Î˛biH }, we perform a double sort
among the individual securities in the estimation period, creating 100 portfolios corresponding to the deciles of the estimated market and hedging-portfolio betas. We re-estimate the
two betas for each of these 100 portfolios in the estimation period, and use these estimated
betas as regressors in the testing period, for which we estimate the following cross-sectional
regression:
Rpt = Îł0t + Îł1t Î˛bpM + Îł2t Î˛bpH + Îˇpt

(52)

where Rpt is the equal-weighted portfolio return for securities in portfolio p, p = 1, . . . , 100,
M
constructed from the double-sorted rankings of the portfolio-estimation period, and Î˛bpt
and
42

Our first portfolio-formation period, from 1962 to 1966, is only four and a half years because the CRSP
Daily Master file begins in July 1962. Fama and MacBethâs (1973) original procedure used a seven-year
portfolio-formation period, a five-year estimation period, and a four-year testing period.
43
This induces a certain degree of survivorship bias, but the effects may not be as severe given that we
apply the selection criterion three periods at a time. Moreover, while survivorship bias has a clear impact
on expected returns and on the size effect, its implications for the cross-sectional explanatory power of the
hedging portfolio is less obvious, hence we proceed cautiously with this selection criterion.

85

H
Î˛bpt
are the market and hedging-portfolio returns, respectively, of portfolio p obtained from

the estimation period. This cross-sectional regression is estimated for each of the 261 weeks

in the five-year testing period, yielding a time series of coefficients {Îłb0t }, {Îłb1t }, and {Îłb2t }.

Summary statistics for these coefficients and their diagnostics are then reported, and this
entire procedure is repeated by incrementing the portfolio-formation, estimation, and testing

periods by five years. We then perform the same analysis for the hedge-portfolio dollar-return
series {QHt }.
Because we use weekly instead of monthly data, it may be difficult to compare our
results to other cross-sectional tests in the extant literature, e.g., Fama and French (1992).
Therefore, we apply our procedure to three other benchmark models: the standard CAPM in
which RM t is the only regressor in (51) and 100 market-beta-sorted portfolios constructed, a
two-factor model in which the hedging-portfolio return factor is replaced by a âsmall-minusbig capitalizationâ or âSMBâ portfolio return factor as in Fama and French (1993), and a
two-factor model in which the hedging-portfolio return factor is replaced by the OFP return
factor described in Section 7.4.44 Tables 19a and 19b report the the correlations between
the different portfolio return factors, returns on CRSP value- and equal-weighted portfolios,
return and dollar return on the hedging portfolio, returns on the SMB portfolio and, OFP,
Beta20, and the two turnover indices.
Tables 20aâ20c summarizes the results of all of these cross-sectional regression tests for
each of the five testing periods from 1972 to 1996. In the first subpanel, corresponding to
the first testing period from 1972 to 1976, there is little evidence in support of the CAPM
or any of the two-factor models estimated.45 For example, the first three rows show that
the time-series average of the market-beta coefficients, {Îłb1t }, is 0.000, with a t-statistic of

0.348 and an average RĚ2 of 10.0%.46 When the hedging-portfolio beta Î˛btH is added to the
regression, the RĚ2 does increase to 14.3% but the average of the coefficients {ÎłĚ2t } is â0.002
with a t-statistic of â0.820. The average market-beta coefficient is still insignificant, but
44

Specifically, the SMB portfolio return is constructed by taking the difference of the value-weighted returns
of securities with market capitalization below and above the median market capitalization at the start of
the five-year subperiod.
45
The two-factor model with OFP as the second factor is not estimated until the second testing period
because we use the 1962â1966 period to estimate the covariances from which the OFP returns in the 1967â
1971 period are constructed. Therefore, the OFP returns are not available in the first portfolio-formation
period.
46
The t-statistic is computed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed coefficients
{Îł1t }, which may not be appropriate. However, since this has become the standard method for reporting
the results of these cross-sectional regression tests, we follow this convention to make our results comparable
to those in the literature.

it has now switched sign. The results for the two-factor model with the hedging-portfolio
dollar-return factor and the two-factor model with the SMB factor are similar.
In the second testing period, both specifications with the hedging-portfolio factor exhibit
statistically significant means for the hedging-portfolio betas, with average coefficients and
t-statistics of â0.012 and â3.712 for the hedging-portfolio return factor and â1.564 and
â4.140 for the hedging-portfolio dollar-return factor, respectively. In contrast, the marketbeta coefficients are not significant in either of these specifications, and are also of the wrong
sign. The only other specification with a significant mean coefficient is the two-factor model
with SMB as the second factor, with an average coefficient of 0.299 for the SMB factor and
a t-statistic of 4.433.
For the three remaining test periods, the only specifications with any statistically significant factors are the SMB and MPP two-factor models in the 1992â1996 testing period.
However, the RĚ2 s in the last two testing periods are substantially lower than in the earlier
periods, perhaps reflecting the greater volatility of equity returns in recent years.
Overall, the results do not provide overwhelming support for any factor in explaining the
cross-sectional variation of expected returns. There is, of course, the ubiquitous problem of
lack of power in these cross-sectional regression tests, hence we should not be surprised that
no single factor stands out.47 However, the point estimates of the cross-sectional regressions
show that the hedging-portfolio factor is comparable in magnitude and in performance to
other commonly proposed factors.

Conclusion

Trading volume is an important aspect of the economic interactions in financial market
among different investors. Both volume and prices are driven by underlying economic forces,
and thus convey important information about the workings of the market. Although the
literature on financial markets has focused on analyzing the behavior of returns based on
simplifying assumptions about the market such as allocational and informational efficiency,
we wish to develop a more realistic framework to understand the empirical characteristics of
prices and volume.
In this article, we hope to have made a contribution towards this goal. By deriving an
explicit link between economic fundamentals and the dynamic properties of asset returns

and volume, we have shown that interactions between prices and quantities in equilibrium
yield a rich set of implications for any asset-pricing model. Indeed, by exploiting the relation
between prices and volume in our dynamic equilibrium model, we are able to identify and
construct the hedging portfolio that all investors use to hedge against changes in market conditions. Moreover, our empirical analysis shows that this hedging portfolio has considerable
forecast power in predicting future returns of the market portfolioâa property of the true
hedging portfolioâand its abilities to explain cross-sectional variation in expected returns is
comparable to other popular risk factors such as market betas, the Fama and French (1993)
SMB factor, and optimal forecast portfolios.
Although our model is purposefully parsimonious so as to focus attention on the essential
features of risk-sharing and trading activity, it underscores the general point that quantities,
together with prices, should be an integral part of any analysis of asset markets, both theoretically and empirically. Our results provide compelling motivation for determining risk
factors from economic fundamentals rather than through statistical means. Although this
is an old theme that has its origins in Black (1972), Mayers (1973), and Merton (1973),
it has become less fashionable as competing approaches such as the statistical approach of
Roll and Ross (1980) and Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) and the empirical approach
of Fama and French (1992) have become more popular. We hope to revive interest in the
lofty goal of identifying risk factors through the logic of equilibrium analysis in general, and
by exploiting the information contained in trading volume in particular.
An important direction for future research is to incorporate more specific aspects of the
market microstructure in the analysis of trading volume. In particular, the two standard
assumptions of perfect competition and symmetric informationâassumptions that we have
also adopted in our theoretical frameworkâdo not hold in practice. For example, for most
individual investors, financial markets have traditionally been considered close to perfectly
competitive, so that the size of a typical investment has little impact on prices. For such
scale-free investment opportunities, quantities are largely irrelevant and returns become the
basic objects of study, not prices. But as institutional investors have grown in size and
sophistication over the past several decades, and as frictions in the trading process have
become more important because of the sheer volume of trade, it has become clear that
securities markets are not perfectly competitive, at least not in the short run.
Moreover, when investors possess private informationâabout price movements, their own
trading intentions, and other market factorsâperfect competition is even less likely to hold.

For example, if a large pension fund were to liquidate a substantial position in one security,
that securityâs price would drop precipitously if the liquidation were attempted through a
single sell-order, yielding a significant loss in the value of the security to be sold. Instead, such
a liquidation would typically be accomplished over several days, with a professional trader
managing the liquidation process by breaking up the entire order into smaller pieces, each
executed at opportune moments so as to minimize the trading costs and the overall impact
of the sale on the market price of the security.48 This suggests that there is information to
be garnered from quantities as well as prices; a 50,000-share trade has different implications
than a 5,000-share trade, and the sequence of trading volume contains information as well.
The fact that the demand curves of even the most liquid financial securities are downwardsloping for institutional investors, and that information is often revealed through the pricediscovery process, implies that quantities are as fundamental as prices, and equally worthy
of investigation.
Finally, the presence of market frictions such as transactions costs can influence the
level of trading volume, and serves as a bridge between the market microstructure literature
and the broader equilibrium asset-pricing literature. In particular, despite the many market
microstructure studies that relate trading behavior to market-making activities and the pricediscovery mechanism,49 the seemingly high level of volume in financial markets has often been
considered puzzling from a rational asset-pricing perspective (see, for example, Ross, 1989).
Some have even argued that additional trading frictions or âsand in the gearsâ ought to be
introduced in the form of a transactions tax to discourage high-frequency trading.50 Yet in
absence of transactions costs, most dynamic equilibrium models will show that it is quite
rational and efficient for trading volume to be infinite when the information flow to the
market is continuous, i.e., a diffusion. An equilibrium model with fixed transactions costs,
e.g., Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2001), may reconcile these two disparate views of trading
volume.
