THML tags are not case sensitive
Browsers do not display the HTML tags,but use them to render the content of the page.
Only the content inside the <body> section is displayed in a browser.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type,and helps browsers to display webpages correctly.
It must only appear once,at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.Empty elements do not
have an end tag,such as <br> element (which indicates a line break).


Some HTML elements will display correctly,even if you forget the end tag.

Empty elements can be 'closed' in the opening tag like this:<br/>

HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed.But if you want stricter validation,
or if you want to make your document readable by XML parsers,you must close all HTML elements properly.

The HTML5 standard does not require values.For example,the href attribute,demonstrated above,
can be written as:
<a href=http://www.w3schools.com>
W3C recommends quotes in HTML,and demands quotas for stricter document types like XHTML.
Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes.The following exmaple will not display the title attribute
correctly,because it contains a space:
<p title=About W3Schools>


The <!DOCTYPE html> decleration defines this document to be HTML5
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the document
The <title> element specifies a title for the document
The <body> element contains the visible page content
The <h1> element difines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph


<h1> This is heading 1</h1>
<h2> This is heading 2</h2>
<h3> This is heading 3</h3>
<h4> This is heading 4</h4>

<p> This is a paragraph.</p>
<p> This is another paragraph.</p>


Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
For more attributes refer to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp

<a href='https:www.w3schools.com'>This is a link</a>
<img src='w3schools.jpg' alt='W3Schools.com' width ='104' height='142'>


The language is declared with the lang attribute.
<html lang='en-US'>

The title Attribute
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you
mouse over the paragraph:
<p title="I'm a tooltip">
This is a paragraph
</p>


The alt Attribute
The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used,when an image cannot be displayed.
<img src='w3schools.jpg' alt='W3Schools.com' width='104' height='142'>


The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page,and is most often displayed as a
horizonal rule.The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an
HTML page.


The HTML <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.
The <head> element is a container for metadata.HTML meatadata is about the HTML document.
Metedata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title,character set,styles,links,scripts,and other meta information.

Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.


With HTML,you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed.

In HTML,spaces and new lines are ignored.


The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),and it
preserves both spaces and line breaks.

The HTML style attribute has the following syntex:
<tagname style='property:value;'>
The property is a CSS property.The value is a CSS value.

<body style='background-color:powderblue;'>
<h1 style='color:blue;'>This is a heading</h1>
<p style='font-family:courier;'>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p style='font-size:300%;'>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>This is a paragraph.</p>


Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text,For example:
<p><b>This text is bold</b><p>
<p><i>This text is italic</i><p>
<p>This is <sub> subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup></p>


<b>-Bold text
<strong>-Important text
<i>-Italic text
<em>-Emphasized text
<mark>-Marked text
<small>-Small text
<del>-Deleted text
<ins>-Inserted text
<sub>-Subscript text
<sup>-Superscript text


The HTML <q> element defines a short quotation.
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.


You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->

<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border='0' src='pic_mountain.jpg' alt='Mountain'>
-->



CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.


For more details,refer to https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp
<style> element to define the internal CSS
<link> element to refer to an external CSS file
<head> element to store <style> and <link> elements


In HTML,links are defined with the <a> tag:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
HTML links are hyperlinks.You can click on a link and jump to another document.

By default,a link will appear like this:
- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was cliked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame


It is common to use images as links:
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a>


HTML Links - Create a Bookmark
For example:
First,create a bookmark with the id attribute:
<h2 id='C4'>Chapter 4</h2>
Then,add a link to the bookmark('Jump to Chapter 4'),from within the same page:
<a href='#C4'>Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Or,add a link to the bookmark('Jump to Chapter 4'),from another page:
<a href='html_demo.html#4'>Jump to Chapter 4</a>


The <img> tag is empty,it contains attributes only,and does not have a closing tag.
The alt attribute is required.A web page will not validate correctly without it.

Image Size:
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and the height of an image.
<img src='html5.gif' alt='HTML5 Icon' style='width:128px;height:128px;'>
Alternatively,you can use the width and height attributes.
<img src='html5.gif alt='HTML5 Icon' width='128' height='128'>

<pre>
<code>
x=5;
y=6;
z=x+y;
</code>

<var>E</var>=<var>mc</var><sup>2</sup>



HTML Entities:
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
&entity_name;
OR
&#entity_number

&nbsp   non-breaking space
&lt     less than
&gt     greater than
&amp    ampersand
&quot   double quotation mark
&apos   single quotation mark(apostrophe)


HTML URL Encode:
A URL can be composed of words(w3schools.com),or an Internet Protocl(IP)
address(192.68.20.50)

A web address,like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
scheme://prefix.domain.port/path/filename


scheme-defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
prefix-defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)

http-HyperText Transfer Protocol:Common web pages.Not encrypted
https-Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol:Secure web pages.Encrypted
ftp-File Transfer Protocol:Downloading or uploading files
file-A file on your computer


URL encoding:
URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set.If a URL
contains character outside the ASCII set,the URL has to be converted.

URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
URLs cannot contain spaces.URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign,or %20











HTML Forms
<input type='text'> defines a one-line text input field
<input type='radio'> defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type='submit'> defines a submit button (for submitting the form)


<form action='/action_page.php' method='get'>
<form action='/action_page.php' method='post'>
The action attribute defines the action to be performed
when the form is submitted.

The default method when submitting form data is GET.
However,when GET is used,the submitted form data will be
visible in the page address field:
/action_page.php?firstname=Mickey&lastname=Mouse
