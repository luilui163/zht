# steps
1. use Dataset to construct stacked df containing all the needed data
2. send the df to Univariate or Bivariate

# data
1. read the documents of GTA about the calculation of the indicators.What's more,the paper it mentions is great guidence for further research.


# functions to add
1. show those significant result with bold characters as table A5 of Asness, Clifford S., Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse Heje Pedersen. “Quality Minus Junk.” SSRN Scholarly Paper. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network, June 5, 2017. https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2312432.
2. D. The risk of quality stocks(Figure 4) in chapter 4 of Asness, Clifford S., Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse Heje Pedersen. “Quality Minus Junk.” SSRN Scholarly Paper. Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network, June 5, 2017. https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2312432.


# TODO:
1. Calculate indicators as other papers
2. detect anomalies in A-share
3. table 5 of mispricing factors
4. read my notes and other papers about cross section
5. D:\app\python27\zht\researchTopics\assetPricing
5. refer to D:\app\python27\zht\researchTopics\assetPricing\regressionModels.py
6. refer to D:\app\python27\zht\researchTopics\assetPricing\multi_getFactorPortId.py for multiprocess method
7. refer to D:\app\python27\zht\researchTopics\assetPricing\tools.py for visualization
8. After finishing this new project refer to the former projects(D:\app\python27\zht\researchTopics\crossSection) to refine my frame
